I think most of the sections are pretty explanatory.

Some things I want to highlight though include that:
- Body Condition State is where I usually put the [[Keel score|Keel score]].
- I have a code for [[Fracture|⛓️‍💥 FX]]
- Remember to follow the rules explained here: [[Filling in a Table in a Callout|Filling in a Table in a Callout]]
