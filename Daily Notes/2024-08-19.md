# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- From last night, Delmar, GHOW had been in yard for 3 days.
- Des Moines, Caller complaining of 3 RTHAs that were circling her farm above her ducks and had killed one. I advised her that is was illegal to do them any harm.
- Davenport at a park, report of a flighted duck that appeared to be missing its entire R foot.
