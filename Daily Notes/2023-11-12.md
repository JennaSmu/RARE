# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Brad]
- Wonder what the red marking on the wall in River Barn cage were from? Have to ask Jodeane sometime. Also noted a dirt on east wall of TUVU cage. Don't know if that is something either.
- Lastly, unplugged the heater per Sonja and provided her with a food inventory from barn. Beautiful day. Got to watch a red headed woodpecker and gray squirrel scolding each other in a cedar tree near the barn.
