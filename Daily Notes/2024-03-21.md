# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Kim]
- All Ed birds fine. Quails for all except Asio (mouse). 
- After I fed everyone, I found a quail head in the food bucket. Not sure who got the headless quail! Lots of deer out today on the drive in. It was very pretty.

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Fairfield, Alisha reported a BAEA in cornfield that she has observed the last 2 days.  She was concerned when it was still there this morning and said it looked in rough shape.  Dan Henderson went out to check on it. The BAEA was gone when he got there and he found a deer carcass that it probably had been feeding on. Thanks to Colin for recommending Dan.
