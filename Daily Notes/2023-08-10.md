>> -  To open and to lock the door the combo code is the same that we use on the barn.  Key in the code, then the unlock or lock button.  Make sure that the door is pulled tight before you try to lock.  The inner door to her cage sticks a bit in the top left corner (humiditty).  When you go into her cage don’t push the door all the way closed or it will stick and be hard to open.  Please only walk in and feed and water.

# 📞Calls:

- Call about a young hawk by a grain silo.  Stopped on my way home to check out the bird.  Baby [2376 AMKE](../RARE%20Birds/2376%20AMKE.md) - Boy.  Displaced from nest.  Looked all over farm for nest or parents, did not see either. Since I had Killy I just took him home with me.  Weighed and checked over, no injuries.  Ate on own and begged from Killy.
