# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Angry man from Fort Dodge removed a nestling killdeer from a drain pipe.  Said he searched a 3 block radius around the pipe for any adults, but he didn’t put the bird down and observe from a distance.  Said he called Blackhawk & Ames Wildlife Center and didn’t get called back from either.  He thought the bird might be favoring one foot, but there were no visible injuries.  I said I thought he should put the bird back near the entrance of the pipe if no rehabbers could take it that day so it wouldn’t get separated from its family since the injuries were very minimal if at all and the bird was already warm and dried from being wet in the pipe.  He did not like that advice and said it was too hot and he would have seen a circle of rocks that was being used as a nest.  He hung up after that, so I don’t know what happened to the bird.
