# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- First thing this morning we went to rural Wellman where a BDOW was caught in fence. DOA- sad because they saw it there yesterday but didn’t know who to call and hoped it would get away- it didn’t.
- Call about a baby owl- not moving in driveway, laying on its side-  but checked on it later and it was gone.
- Call about an injured baby bird in Iowa City- referred to Dr. Jana
-Call about a baby bat in Hickory Hill Park - referred to Jeremy Richardson who agreed to go pick it up.
