# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Bunnies in yard that dog got - 2am - returned call, no answer and no VM
- Duck in quad cities with a growth on its face. Message garbled, unable to understand number.
- Duck nest in yard. Caller was worried that they would be hit by cars when they hatched and wanted to move the nest.  I explained that the nest would not be moved and that the duck felt that her yard was safe and that is why they built the nest.  I advised that she keep an eye on the nest and she might help them cross the street (stop traffic on Brady St)  to get to the park when they are ready to go.
