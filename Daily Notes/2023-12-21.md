# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::Kim, Denise]
- Call about volunteering, Kim has info
- IC, Blank & McCune, 1 block off Burlington on the corner of Van Buren and College. Christina 319-325-8785 reported a hawk that had been grounded in their parking lot today, when approached she said it only hopped and couldn’t fly. I went in and found it sitting in front of a car, it flew off when I was within about 6 feet of it. It flew across the street, across a creek and landed on top of a chain link fence. It can fly but doesn't get much height. Looked like a SSHA. I told them to keep an eye out for it. Wonder if there was any connection to call yesterday as it appears to be in the same vicinity.
- UPDATE - IC Animal Control picked up what they think was an injured COHA by the police department. As she was unloading it to take into the shelter it flew off and landed nearby an open barn/salt pile at the streets department. She notified the workers and will check tomorrow to see if it’s still in the vicinity.  Mara 319-936-4828
- IC - Margaret McGinnis 508-404-8586, 616 N. 1st Avenue, She thinks injured RTHA in her backyard. Observed eating a rabbit but she thought its wing didn’t look right and it may be limping. I told her to call the RARE number back tomorrow morning if it was still there.
