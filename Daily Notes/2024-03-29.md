- Calls - Barred owl HBC in Rockford Ill, Referred to Yoder
- Turkey Vulture not flying in Keokuk, she has observed for 2 days. - Finder not able to catch bird.  The bird is in a city water treatment area behind a 6 foot fence, private property.  She called the city & animal control but at the time she called me no one had gotten back to her.  I advised that if they caught it we could take it.
