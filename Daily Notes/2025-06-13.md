# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Cedar Rapids, observed hawk on ground, doesn’t fly when approached. Asked him to send pic to see if juvenile, explained normal behavior. He didn’t send pic, replied back it was probably a juvenile and was fine.
- Rural West Branch, AMKE down on ground, dog got ahold of it. I met him in West Branch this morning. New admit above 2566.
- Davenport, young fawn in the yard for several days. Trail cam shows it by itself day and night not getting cared for. She has been feeding it milk replacement after getting no help from DNR and understands it’s illegal to rehab deer in Iowa. Looking for advice and guidance.
- Muscatine, baby bird with what she thought was a broken neck after she saw it fall. Mom is still feeding it. She was going to place it back in its nest.
- Palo, injured Bluebird. Caller’s mom has had it for over a week. Referred to IBR.
