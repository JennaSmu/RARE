# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Goose with injured leg in IC, he flew into a pond near their home when they tried to catch him.  They said they’d try again, so I suggested trying to lure him with peas. 
- Baby bunnies in New Sharon.
- Hawk probably hit window/wall in Dubuque, (563) 599-0892, he thought Wildthunder was closer, so I gave him their # but told him to call back if they can’t take him. 
- Deer with something clear wrapped around its leg IC, told them no one can rehab deer and gave Erica Billerbeck’s # (JC DNR).  Skinny fox in North Liberty.
