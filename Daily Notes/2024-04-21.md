# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Fairfield Dispatch had a 911 call last night about a hit BAEA by roadside. They verified a pickup by Henry County DNR last night, but no message from DNR today.
- RTHA in Williamsburg area. Captured by finder (they followed the vm instructions and were very appreciative of them!). They have the RTHA secured in a box in their shed. Halie and Colin are coordinating a drop-off time for Monday.
- GHOW in Independence. Stated he already contacted Wild Thunder and was waiting for a callback from them. Will reach out again to us if no response.
