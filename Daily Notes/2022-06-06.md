# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Colin]
- Colin took some supplies with me to care for the HY GHOW and any other babies I will be taking to work. I put a list of the things I took on the dry erase calendar.  I also took the small scale from the barn so I can keep up with the GHOWs progress.  I will return it once he is released.
- ****NO BIRDS CURRENTLY AT CLINIC**** until a new admit comes in, no one needs to physically be at clinic.
- Bird freezer cleaned out, still 2 eagles and several salvage birds.
