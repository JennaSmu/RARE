# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Sonja]
- The food in the bucket (small rat) did not thaw out.  I turned the heater up a smidge.
- Please be careful when coming and going on the lane. As I started down the first hill, I luckily saw Alicia coming down the lane from the barn, so I was able to back up and pull off.
- Raked cages, did not change out the waters.
