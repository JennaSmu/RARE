# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Sparrow - fledge.  Finder wanted someone to take it because there were cats in the area.  I asked him to keep the cats locked up or put the baby up in a makeshift nest.  
- Hawk hit a window outside a bank in Marion.  Advised them to catch it, (throw towel or blanket over it.)  When they approached the bird flew off.
