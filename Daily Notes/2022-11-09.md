# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Someone called about a baby goose floating in the lake, but not flying. Gave her Dr. Jana’s number. Seems really late for that.  It could’ve been a migrating grebe or something like that.
- Someone found a dead RTHA and DNR told them to call us.  I left a vm.  Didn’t really know what to tell her. 
- I had a possum stuck in my garage this afternoon.  Guess what? I didn’t call RARE for it.  ;) (but technically I guess I did, because I texted Colin - thanks for the tips)
