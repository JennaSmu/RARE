>> ##### 💊 Meds:
>> - [Metacam](../Admin/Codes/Medication/Metacam.md) [PO](../Admin/Codes/Per%20os.md)
>> - Clavacilin
>> - [ ] #🦅🩺-bird-care Give 1.3 mL of 1.5 mg/mL Metacam through 8/11.
>> - [ ] #🦅🩺-bird-care Give Clavacillan dose from pill box in bag on chart for 7 days through 8/13.
>> 	- The calculated dose was 100 mg (because the orange book dose was for 12 hrs, so I had to double it), but I opened a 250 mg tablet so the closest dosage increment that I could cut was 83 mg.  I added 12 mg of leftover Clavacillian to today’s dose to get 95 mg.
>>
>> ##### 🩺Caregiving:
>> - Did not suture so the wounds could drain. 
>> - Cleaned with nolvasan and wrapped with a ball wrap.
>> - [Applied tail sheath](../Admin/Codes/Applied%20tail%20sheath.md)
>>
>>##### 🫧 Clean:
>> - [ ] #🦅🩺-bird-care Restrict to 1 side of the double cage until at least 8/10.
>>
>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - Both of the bullets came to the surface of his foot, and one of them was removed by Jodeane. 
>> 	- She couldn’t get the other one out and thought that’s because it was encased in callused scar tissue / bone.
