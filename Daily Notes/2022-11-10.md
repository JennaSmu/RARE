# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Lady wanting some information about bats.  I directed her to Marlene, as I didn’t have an answer to her question.  She ended up calling me right back as she wasn’t getting anyone to answer her calls or return her texts.  I explained that we are all volunteers, most with full time jobs and the calls will be returned.  She needed to be patient.
