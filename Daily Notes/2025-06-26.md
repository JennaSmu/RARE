# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Baby sparrow, called left message, no return call. 
- Night Hawk, Quad Cities - thought was injured, hopped/ran away dragging wing.  Continued to go back to the same spot. To me it sounded like it was trying to lure him away from the nest.  He was going to check out the next time he was at the plant. 
- BJ - From IC, Scott Blvd.  Observed a hawk on her fence for 4 hours, with another one visiting.  She sent a photo, young bird.  Alert and perching.  I asked her to keep an eye on him and let us know if he appears lethargic or is laying down.
