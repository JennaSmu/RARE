# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Jodi (mammal rehabber) from Keota has been in contact with us the last couple days about a potentially injured TUVU.  She said it is in better shape today than yesterday, and seems to be flying better than it was, but still not great.  She will let us know if she continues to see it and/or if she catches it.
