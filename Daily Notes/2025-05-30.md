- Charlene in CR captured a baby owl that’s was seen on the street. Said one eye is completely shut. Mel went to check it out an its actually an adult EASO. Molly transported to clinic and put in cage with rolly bed. Will need full exam tomorrow - notified Saturday’s crew.
- Andy with Cedar County Conservation was given a GHOW found in a ditch. Molly met him at clinic. Placed in cage with a rolly bed and perch. Standing in back of cage when I left. Will need full exam tomorrow - notified Saturday’s crew.
- Injured robin in Lisbon. Referred to Dr Jana.
- Injured pigeon in Fairfield. Referred to Dr Jana.
- Injured owl in Davenport. When I called back they had already gotten a hold of Hog Capital Wildlife Rescue in Kewanee IL who is going to send someone out. Gave her my cell in case no one comes over.
- Baby songbird found in parking garage in UIHC. Finder wasn’t sure where it came from or where the nest is. Referred to Dr Jana.
- Two calls about the same injured hawk in Davenport at Scott Community College. When I called back the finder said he thinks his boss might’ve gotten a hold of someone else. Told him to call back if that wasn’t the case.
- Owl on the ground in Cresco, IA for 5 days. Was going to have the finder send me a picture, but when he approached it flew away. Also gave him the number for Black Hawk for the future since they’re a little closer but assured him he can always call us about a bird if needed, too!
