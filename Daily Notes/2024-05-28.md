# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- NE of Dubuque on river, (Rich Miesck 920-960-1587). BAEA fledgling on ground, 2 siblings in nest above. Concerned it had blown out of nest and injured. He had already reached out to DNR. I told him to reach out to County Conservation Nate Johnson who is familiar with nest to check out and then to get back to us if needed.
- Muscatine, 3 orphan baby birds, mother deceased. She was transporting to Dr. Jana.
- Davenport, Weerts Funeral Home, observed fledgling RTHA on ground so concerned it was injured. When I called back they said parent had delivered a squirrel. Told them normal behavior and to leave alone.
