>> ##### 🩺Caregiving:
>> - We put wound wash on the right wing wound area and cleaned it up a bit, then applied TAB to it with a layer of gauze and then tegaderm.
>> - The bird kept on biting the area or getting a talon stuck in the wound, so we placed a large canvas wrap over it to keep him from getting at it.
