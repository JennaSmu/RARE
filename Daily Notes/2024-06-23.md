>> [!Medical]+
>> ##### 🩺Caregiving:
>> - Wound was flushed again twice and a wet to dry bandage was laid over top. 
>> - It was very difficult to get the Tegaderm to stick in the right spot. 
>> 	- For next time, I’d apply the bandage while his neck is stretched out all the way, or it will move when he puts his head in a normal resting position. 
>>
>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - 1 black mite but no maggots seen.
>> - Was difficult to get to take food at first but once we got some food down this bird ate the top part of a quail breast very eagerly.
