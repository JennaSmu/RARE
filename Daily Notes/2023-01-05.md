# 🏡Barn:

- The heater that was in the cabinet to thaw the food has been removed due to the potential fire hazard. I bought a refrigerator to be used for thawing the food, this is NOT a garage grade refrigerator, so I’m not sure how well this will work. Garage grade refrigerators only come in a standard size, and are costly. I initially put it in the cabinet, but the door doesn’t open all the way.  It is now sitting on the cabinet.  We will need to see how this works, I might need to change the direction that the door opens. At this time it is OFF because the freon has to settle, but I put food inside.

>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - Seems to be improving somewhat. 
>> - Can fly from the corner perch to the jump in the middle of the cage, but can’t make the flight from the jump back to the corner. Not sure if she can get the height. 
>> - Spread food around the cage on several of the perches.
