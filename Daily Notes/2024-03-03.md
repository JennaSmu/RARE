>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - Divider was left in cage when we arrived was unable to reach food on the other side.
>> - Tried a whole mouse with head aimed toward beak and she grabbed it 3 times but dropped before she could swallow and wouldn’t pick it up, I tried to grab her beak with other hand this was a mistake it stressed her too much and she laid down in cage, put food on perch and moved her to the other side and cleaned the other side and put a towel over cage to reduce stress, but she did not eat while we were at clinic

# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Brad]
- While recording this data in notebook a groundhog walked in the barn and walked under the stairs and under the decking. Had little concern for me. We should monitor this to make sure it isn't damaging the barn.
