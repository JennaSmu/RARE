# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- About an owl roosting on a AC unit. - called and left message, no return call.
- Another call about an owl roosting on a building ledge, landlord put down the spiky strips - caller wanted to talk to someone about this.
- Call about a bird with broken leg, referred to Dr Jana.
- Call about baby bird in yard, had feathers, I advised that if it was not injured to put it back.  She said she had dogs, I advised that she put them on a leash until the baby learned to fly.  She wasn’t open minded about that.
- Call about a baby coon, eyes not open in the middle of a driveway. I gave Gaylas number, but I also asked her to try to put back where they found it and see if the mama came back for it, perhaps she was spooked when moving it. 🙂
