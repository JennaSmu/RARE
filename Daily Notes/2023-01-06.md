- The food in the fridge was frozen. 😣 I put the heater back in the cabinet so that we could have thawed food on Saturday.  I do want to get the fridge plugged in, hoping that it will keep the food “warmer” than the outside temp.
- It's not plugged in at this time, as I didn’t want the heater and the fridge both plugged in at the same time.

- Caller from Sioux City, had found a hawk that was unable to fly.  Was going back to catch after I explained how.  Gave him Kay’s number.
