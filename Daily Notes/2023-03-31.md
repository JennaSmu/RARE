# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Baby bunny call from Sigorney, Ia, found on a sidewalk.  Called back no answer, left a few numbers in a VM
- Baby racoon in Powasheik Cty, Called back no answer.  Tested him several numbers.  Jodi Rigler was going to call him.
- Call regarding a bat in Iowa City.  They had left it on the sidewalk because they wanted to get home before the storm.  They gave the address and we were expected to pick up. Called back - no answer. Left them a message to go back and see if the bat was still there, if it was could they scoop up without touching.  No return call.
