# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Dawn]
- Washed divider in sink & swept.
- Music was off at 11:45, medium loud but too much bass @ 1:15, on & off between acceptable & too much bass till 6 pm.
- I was dusting the washer and pushed some button by accident, and the cycle started.  I held the Start/Pause button for more than 3 seconds a bunch of times, but it wouldn’t shut off, so I unplugged the whole thing.  I’m hoping it will behave normally tomorrow once it is plugged back in.

# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Sonja]
- Raked cages, changed water, scrubbed cement pads in the corn crib.
- I have set up the bucket heater, it is on the ground in the food box.   Do not hang the bucket as the wrap heater will slide off.  
- The food is in a metal bucket with a lid, the plastic pail is on the inside and can be easily taken out to feed.  I have the temperature gauge set in the middle, there is a thermometer inside the plastic bucket.  Adjust if necessary.  Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Goose w/angel wing in Davenport - finder said he would try to catch it & take to Dr. Jana. 
- Dan Tyler found a hawk on his property in Mccausland (Scott Co) today. It was lethargic and didn’t try to get away from him at all.  He picked it up and put it in a cage. DNR told him to call us. Jessica Ramey picked it up from him, transferred it to a box, and took it to Tamara Yarger (Hog Capitol Rehab: Kewanee) because she couldn’t come all the way here so it wouldn’t have gotten seen today, no one else could either, and Kewanee was actually closer than IC.
