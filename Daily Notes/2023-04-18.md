# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Nancy]
- Saw a BAOW in trees near farmhouse, eating a mouse or small prey!!  Then there was a lot of vocalizing between at least two wild owls.  One blue-jay came and briefly harassed perched owl, who clacked its beak but seemed otherwise unperturbed.  Great wild owl-watching bonus today!
