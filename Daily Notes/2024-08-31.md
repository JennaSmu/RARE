# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Owl that went to another rehabber
- TUVU in Grinnell with wing dragging on ground - elderly woman said no one could catch it - I said we could treat it and maybe meet her halfway if she could find someone to catch it but that we couldn’t drive 70 min each way to catch the bird and suggested she call her DNR officer or Iowa Bird Rehab - went to IBR
- Crow in Grinnell - flew off,
- Very lethargic GHOW on ground in Wheatland - she scooped it into a box and was going to come tomorrow, but he died later in the day
- HY BDOW in Bloomfield that was in the road and flew up and bumped a car that was going slowly - picked up by IBR volunteer in Ottumwa.
