# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Baby duck in swimming pool. - no city, called left message, did not return call.
- Baby robin fledge - Finder just wanted reassurance that leaving him on ground was the thing to do.  Advised to keep cats and dogs away.
- Deck getting torn down, nest in hanging flower pot.  Advised to rehang close to where it was originally.
- Baby deer in yard since Tuesday, DNR gave her our number.  Called back advised that no rehabbers in Iowa can rehab baby deer.  Asked if the ears were curled or if it was crying.  No to both questions.  I told her that I believed that Mama was still coming back at night to feed and care for the baby and to just give space.  She thanked me.
- Muscatine - Paul Taylor has seen an eagle on an island for the last 2 weeks, same place, not moving, L wing appears to be injured.  The island is by the Vealy Slew, Iowa side; Fairport.  Illinois side; Loud Thunder.  Asked him if he was able to capture, or provide help, as we did not have the means to do a water rescue.  Contacted Sara Schmucher at USFW, she will reach out to conservation areas looking for boat resources.  She will get exact location from Paul and if able to capture contact me.
- Fledgling in North Liberty, by the time I called her back she had gone to our website and followed the “what to do when you find a baby bird”  YAY MCayla.
