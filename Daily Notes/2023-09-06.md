# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Sparrow nest with nestlings found in a newly purchased RV. Advised to move the nest under deck with other sparrow nests to be fed by adoptive parents.
- Call from Whitney in CR and Allan (neighbor) shortly after. Spoke with Whitney. She found a night hawk that flew inside her car. Maybe its R wing injured. Referred to Dr. Janna.
