# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Message from midnight last night about owl on melrose ave near interstate. I investigated on my way from barn to clinic and could not find it.
- HY COHA in Iowa City. Advised how to make a makeshift nest.
- Bird nest fell down in Davenport. 1 survivor. Advised to re-attach nest to tree or call Dr Jana.
- HY AMKE in Maquoketa. Advised to look for nest and put back, otherwise she is able to bring it to clinic tomorrow if she cannot locate the nest. I will coordinate with Dawn/Halie if it needs to come in. She has had it since friday and has been feeding it ground beef. Advised not to feed it anything else, and that ground beef is not a proper diet for a AMKE.
- Call from Davenport company that wants an active bird nest removed. Advised almost all nesting birds are federally protected and nests cannot be removed while active. Referred to Scott Co DNR for more info.
- **Please make sure to erase voicemails on the days you are scheduled. There were 3 old voicemails from Fri and Sat on the machine. If the call is unresolved, take down the info, erase the message, and relay the info to whomever needs it.**
