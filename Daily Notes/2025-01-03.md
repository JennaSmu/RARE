# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Kim, Flo]

> [!info]-
> - [ ] #⚠️-attention Can we get a couple of pet taxi boxes for transport at the barn? We found an old cardboard box today and there is nothing else. I will bring out plain boxes for transport, I don’t want to tie up the pet taxis for the barn. 
> 	- [ ] I had thought we had several mid size boxes in the loft at the Barn under the tarp.  Sonja
> - [ ] #⚠️-attention The food isn’t quite thawed. Not sure how warm we want it…I had the bucket heater on low because it was warmer out. 
> 	- [ ] Now that it is colder we will need to adjust.  I will check with the next person on to see if they can turn up. Sonja
> - [ ] #⚠️-attention Pens won’t write because they are frozen. I wonder if we can keep the pens in a baggie in the food container? Or near it? 
> 	- [ ] Great idea Kim.  Next person on if they can put 1 or 2 pens in the metal bucket that would be great.  Sonja
> - [ ] #⚠️-attention The paths to Bano and Denali aren’t cleared. It’s fine for now, but if we get 10 inches of snow, it's going to be really hard to walk out there.  
> 	- [ ] I had shovels out there last winter, I think I brought those home.  I will bring a few more out to get paths shoveled.  I will also check with Alicia on shoveling to the cages.  Sonja**
