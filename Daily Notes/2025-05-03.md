- Someone in Anamosa had cut down a tree and then found a baby dove on the ground. Couldn’t see a nest anywhere and didn’t see a nest in the tree before . Gave him numbers for Wild Thunder and Dr Jana, since they’re both about an hour away.
- Sherry in Lisbon because they cut down a tree in their yard and then realized there was a squirrel’s nest. There’s one baby squirrel that’s alive. Gave her numbers for Dr Jana and Wapsi River Wildlife Project since they’re both about 30 min away.
