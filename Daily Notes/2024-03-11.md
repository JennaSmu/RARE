# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Colin, Lia]
- Please do not put Killy’s green turf in the washing machine. There were dozens of little green pieces in the bottom of the washing machine when I went to load it into the dryer. The black ones do not seem to be shedding, but they also don’t seem to look very clean after coming out of the washer, so maybe we should be hand washing all the turf for killy’s cage just to be safe and sanitary.

>> - He is still favoring his R foot.
>> - I only had him in the window long enough to clean his cage. I worry that since his foot/leg isn’t back to 100% yet, a jump/fall from the window could further injure or prolong recovery?

# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Colin]
- The door going into the Ransom Cage from the main area where the food is located is in need of repair. The wood planks on the inside of the door have come loose at the top. Far HP needs fixed as well. Should just be able to put the ends of the branch back in the holes. I did not have access to a ladder to do this otherwise I would have.
