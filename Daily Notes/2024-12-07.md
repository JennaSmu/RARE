>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - Had to pry open her beak to put each bite in her mouth but she swallowed once the bites were in.
>> - Her keel bone feels really sharp, there is some meat on her pecs, but I don’t think the bone would feel that sharp if she were at a healthy weight, so maybe an injection of Vitamin B would be helpful to stimulate her appetite.

>>##### 🩺Caregiving:
>> - Unwrapped bandage, P1, P2, & entire L foot were still swollen, soaked foot in Nolvasan and warm water, debrided wound (still very reactive while handling wound), applied Vetasan and ball wrap. I only removed the tissue which peeled off easily and didn’t open the white/yellow crack in the deepest part of the wound to the point where it bled.  I’m not sure if I removed enough.  Also noticed a small wound on R foot which we wrapped in gauze around the hock & taped to itself but left the foot free.
