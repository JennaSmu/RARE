# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Sonja, Teal]
- There was an issue with Bano’s door latching, contacted Alicia.  We were able to get the door to latch.  You have to pull the door closed hard. If you are unable to get the door to latch, Alicia added a chain and latch. There is a padlock in the food warmer box, just use that to attach the chain to the latch. The padlock is a key lock, please add it to the key ring with the key for the barn cage. Please contact Sonja if you have any questions. Alicia will be out of town next week.
- All other birds fed & good.
