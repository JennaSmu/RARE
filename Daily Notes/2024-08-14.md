> [!info]-
> - Jeanine & Elana recorded the error code on washer and texted to Sonja. 
> 	- I have sent the error code to Dan and we are back on the list to get it fixed.  He will call the day before to schedule the appointment.
>  - Please make sure to shake out the towels; poop, food pieces, feathers etc are going through the wash cycle.  These can clog drain and affect the toilet & washer
>  - Please make sure that you unroll the rolly beds.  
>  - Do not wash the black mats.  If you use them for Killys cage they need to be hand washed.  
>  - Please let me know if you have any questions.  Sonja.  Leave at the top.
