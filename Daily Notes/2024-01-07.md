# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Injured owl in Ottumwa. Tried to coordinate dropoff on Monday, but due to the incoming weather the finder wanted the bird admitted today. I was finished with clinic and on my way to the barn by the time we tried to arrange something. Finder was able to take the owl to Blackhawk.
