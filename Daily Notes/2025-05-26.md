# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Injured robin in yard. Left VM asking for location so I could refer out. Did not receive a call back.
- Injured turkey vulture on ground at farm in Mt Vernon. Originally seen on Friday and was still on the ground today. Molly helped capture and transported to clinic (new admit above)
- Owl found on side of the road on finder’s way to work in Dubuque. Finder captured and brought it to work. Molly picked it up and took to clinic (new admit above).
- Baby hawk on Croell St in Tiffin by Fairway. Left VM asking to check if it was still there and to send me a picture. Did not hear back. Checked out the area on my way home from barn but did not see anything.
- Six baby ducks without parent found in West Branch. Referred to Dr. Jana.
- Juvenile barred owl on ground in CR. Finder sent me a picture - confirmed it’s a fledgling. They’ve been seeing adults in the area but not today (although it sounded like they were in the yard for most of the afternoon). Confirmed there isn’t a risk of dogs or kids bothering the owl in their yard. Asked them to keep an eye out and call us back if it’s still on the ground or they don’t see parents by tomorrow.
