# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Turtle hit by car, and multiple song bird fledges - referred.
- COHA fledge in Eldridge.  Photo showed injuries around the neck.  Finder called DNR after us and they examined the bird and dispatched the bird, due to the extent of the injuries and that he was covered in fly larvae.
