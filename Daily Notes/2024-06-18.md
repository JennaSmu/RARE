>> ##### 💊 Meds:
>> - 3mL fluids split between inguinals.
>>
>> ##### 🩺Caregiving:
>> - Placed in cage with Killy.  He went up to Killy begging for food several times, and Killy was fighting him off, so we removed him and I took him home for a night.  I’ve been hand feeding cut up pieces with the owl puppet while playing AMKE noises. 
>>
>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - Exam showed no major injuries.
>> - He won’t pick up food from a stump on his own. 
>>
>> ##### 🗨️ Treatment Comments:
>> - Sonja thinks he needs to be eating on his own before he can be put into a nest box. 
>> - Please put him in with [Killy](../RARE%20Birds/Ed%20Birds/Killy.md) again, but do not leave them unattended unless you see the juvenile beg Killy for food and Killy feed or ignore the juvenile without fighting him at all several times. 
>> - If Killy is still aggressive, please put the juvenile in a separate cage with 3 mice cut up in small pieces in a dish or on a stump.

>> [!Medical]+
>> ##### 💊 Meds:
>> - Used diluted chlorhexidine to clean as best as we could and applied [TAB](../Admin/Codes/Medication/Triple%20Antibiotic.md) eye ointment to the scabs on his beak and below his eyes.
>> - Gave 35 mL fluids split between [inguinals](../Admin/Codes/inguinals.md)
>>
>> ##### 🩺Caregiving:
>> - Placed in cage with perch and rolly bed/warm buddy option.
>>
>> ##### 🗨️ Treatment Comments:
>> - Please give an iron injection into a pec muscle tomorrow only and use a solution with a capful of Novasan/Chlordhexidine in a bowl of warm water to thoroughly wipe (in the direction of feather growth) all the affected areas with dried scabs of blood on them.
>> - Put TAB eye ointment (no Dex) with a q-tip or cotton ball on the scabs near his eyes probably for several days until most of the scabs are healed, or he is preening them on his own. 
>> - Please skin m for tomorrow and don’t force them if he won’t eat them all. 
>> 	- As his keel score was 1.5, and I’m a bit concerned about re-feeding syndrome.
>> 		- He might not be able to digest fur if he hasn’t eaten in awhile.
