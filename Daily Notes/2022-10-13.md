# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Bettendorf police dispatch called regarding a hawk that was in the road.  They indicated that they had it contained.  Arrangements were made to transport to Colin at Nahant.  Hawk was delivered to Colin.
- 15 minutes later a call from a gal in Bettendorf regarding a hawk that was in her parking lot.  I was instructing her on how to catch the bird when she went to catch it, and it flew off.
