# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Denise, Jodeane]
- From Jodeane - Anesthesia machine was left on again after last use.
- I will be creating a log sheet for anyone using the anesthesia machine.  It must be signed that you used the machine, dated and it will have a checklist to go through to make sure that the machine gets turned off as it should.  - Sonja

# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Sonja, Jodeane]
- I removed the heating bucket and was going to get the refrigerator set up for summer food  thawing.  Someone placed discarded mice in the refrigerator, it was gross and smelly.  Old discarded food should ONLY be put in the freezer.  I left the refrigerator open to air out, I will get it cleaned out and set up tomorrow.
- We are also short on food, please make sure you are communicating to Me, Colin, Elana or look at the calendar and see who will be doing barn and clinic next and ask them to bring food out.  Halie will be bringing food out Thursday.
