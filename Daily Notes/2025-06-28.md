# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::Molly, Jay]
- Call last night about an RTHA in Davenport not flying in someone’s yard. Called back this morning - it had flown away a couple hours later. Sounded like a younger bird based on description.
- RTHA on ground in park in Davenport. Received a video and confirmed it’s a fledgling. Standing upright with no apparent injuries. Instructed caller to let us know if she sees it again lying prone or appearing to be injured.
- Bat box fell with bats inside - referred to Wild Thunder.
- Songbird in Eagle Point Park in Clinton IA. Looked like a fledgling that was fine, but gave them other contacts if needed.
