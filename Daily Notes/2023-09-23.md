# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Dawn, Hailey]
- I bought a micro USB cord, which fit in the modem, but the computer still couldn’t get on the network. Hailey also showed me how to make my phone a hotspot.  That didn’t fix it either, but I’m not sure if my phone plan includes the hotspot feature.  It let me turn it on, but I don’t know if that means you have that feature in your plan.
