>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - [24130 BAEA](../RARE%20Birds/24130%20BAEA.md) - When on ground generally goes to the corner.  L wing is still held out and droopy.  I feel like I see her pick it up and tuck it some times, its quick but I’m hopeful.  She was back up on the ramp perch with 135 when I left. 
>> - [24135 BAEA](../RARE%20Birds/24135%20BAEA.md) - Was on the ramp perch with 130 when I came in.  Both birds jumped down, 135 flew to the far side and landed on the wall ledge.  Flight is very sloppy at this time, R wing drops a bit when perchine.  Did 3 flights across cage (back and forth)

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Rob 319-538-7967 spotted hawk on side of 380 southbound close to mile marker 37 between CR and Centerpoint. He thought it was limping. Heads up for tomorrow’s crew if we get any calls on it or if any volunteer is in the neighborhood and can check out.
