>> - [Metacam](../Admin/Codes/Medication/Metacam.md) [PO](../Admin/Codes/Per%20os.md)
>>
>> ##### 🩺Caregiving:
>> - I couldn’t find a canvas wrap that fit, only ones that were too large or too small, so I did a Fig. 8 wing and body wrap to relieve pressure on the neck area. 
>>
>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - He is very feisty and refused to swallow the Metacam for over a minute.
>> - He wouldn’t let go of a glove, so we left it in the cage with him and wouldn’t stand up, so we leaned him against the perch and covered the cage with a towel while we were in clinic. 
>> 	- We removed the towel before we left, and he hadn’t moved at all.
>>
>> ##### 🗨️ Treatment Comments:
>> - An x-ray might be helpful.
