# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Sonja, Halie]
- USDA PRELIMINARY INSPECTION - Went well, we have some items that need to be changed before we can set a date for our “real” Inspection.
- I want to thank everyone for all of the cleaning and picking up that was done at the clinic and the barn.  Proud to work with each and everyone of you.  THANK YOU!
