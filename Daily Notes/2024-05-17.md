# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Baby rabbits in Fairfield.  Dog disrupted the nest, they renested the babies but felt like the mother hadn’t returned.  Gave number of rehabber in Burlington.
- Bat perching on the side of house, advised to keep an eye on it and it should take off around dusk.
- Bird nest above front door, did not realize this, when they opened door and displaced the babies.  Put the nest back - he was just calling to make sure that he did the right thing and wondered if he should do anything else.  They will use the back door until babies leave.
