>>
>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - Felt a hard callus on L tibiotarsus
>> - His right foot has 2 bullets in it, but the toes are very warm, so we’re giving it some more time to see if it improves.

>> ##### 🩺Caregiving:
>> - The skin has scabbed over on his injury below his vent.  We did not want to debride and applied a layer of Vetasan ointment on it. 
>> - [ ] #🦅🩺-bird-care Can you see how it’s doing tomorrow and add more ointment if dry?  Please don’t remove any tissue, we are afraid to reopen the wound.

## [2483 BAEA](../RARE%20Birds/2483%20BAEA.md):
> [!multi-column]+
>
>> [!notice]
>> ##### 💥Significant Event:
>> - (se-2483-BAEA:: [😭 Euthanized](../Admin/Codes/Euthanized.md))
>>
>> ##### 🗨️Comments:
>> - [Euthanized due to poor prognosis](../Admin/Codes/Euthanized%20due%20to%20poor%20prognosis.md)
>> - Dawn will notify finder.
>
>> [!Medical]+
>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - His legs haven’t improved since the first week, and we wouldn’t expect any fractures to heal for a month.  He was injuring his wings trying to prop himself up in the cage and getting poop on his face. 
>> - Bathing takes time, and appropriate pain medication at the dose for an eagle is very expensive. 
>> - We did not think that it was worth putting that much stress on the bird in addition to the time and expense for the amount of time it was going to take to wait to find out if he was going to improve and if the fx was going to heal in a functional position.
