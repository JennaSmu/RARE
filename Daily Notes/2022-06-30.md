# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Dave Baake - GHOW very thin, slow to respond.  Passed.
- Baby Kestrels in the roof of a pole barn that was being reroofed.  We had a plan that Jodean was going to meet the contractor with a nest box on Friday so he could put them in a box.  He texted Thursday evening that he was not going back to that job on Friday and that another contractor was.  JC was going to contact him..
- There will be a call on the answering machine from Devin Craig - He also contacted us through FB Messenger - I called.  Fledgling Kestrel - boy..  :)

# 🏫 Education:
- [Killy](../RARE%20Birds/Ed%20Birds/Killy.md) and [River](../RARE%20Birds/Ed%20Birds/River.md) did programs at Loving Arms Child Care and the Kalona Public Library. They did a third impromptu program for Dr Eberts family. Both did a great job.
