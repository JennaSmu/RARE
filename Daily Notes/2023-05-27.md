# 🏡Barn:

>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - Doing well.
>> - Wild BDOW grabbed this one by the wing through the ceiling while I was there. I did not see any blood, so I think it just grabbed its wing feathers. Found some lumber in the barn and put it up there so he cannot access that section of the rafters anymore (there was a 1-2 inch gap between the ceiling and the wall in that section - north wall facing the old horse pasture).

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- 1 call about a large egg that was found (finder said 2-3x the size of a chicken egg). I think it’s probably goose, and referred to Dr. Jana.
- Bleach-mopped floor (opened window, propped door open, and ceiling fans on). Elana came in and we put in some work getting the caked-on poop off the floor in front of the cages, and made some good headway! Feel free to use some bleach and the wire brush by the sink to chip away at it if you have time.
