# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Shaha, (319) 936-1120, called about a nestling with possible blood on its head on the ground near the Bread Garden (downtown IC).  She said she’s going back that way in an hr after class.  I told her to check if it’s really blood or just skin that looks very pink without the feathers and call Dr. Jana if it’s injured and renest if it’s not injured and doesn’t feel cold.  I texted her later but never heard back.
