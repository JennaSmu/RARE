# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Sonja, Richard, Elana]
- Please remember to keep an eye on the food and question it if you think its getting low..  Lets just say it will take at least a week to get it to us.  Thank you all for your help.
- I have ordered food. They will ship on Monday, delivery expected on Wednesday. I have updated the delivery location to my house.  Please if the mice\rats are in good condition, leave them for another day. I HF some of the mice left from Wednesday to the baby AMKE. We are very short on mice until this order comes in.
- All birds in the freezer have been taken to the crematorium.  
- When a bird passes or is released:
	- We need to update the case log book with the outcome (D=died, E=Euthanized, R=Released and the date)
	- We need to update the blue sheet for the bird.  This is the sheet that has the finder information on it
	- The case number and the species need to be added to the white board on the freezer.

# 📞Calls:
