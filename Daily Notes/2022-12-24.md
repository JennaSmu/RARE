# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Josh - from Anamosa DOT called about 2 small hawks that had taken up residence in their garage.  I advised to open the doors.  He called back and said that they had flown off.
- Josh from Fruitland out deer hunting found a GHOW in a snow drift.  Wrapped him up in his coat.  He called back, owl is alert, but not flying.  He was going back out hunting and unable to transport.   Asked him to keep him in a quiet warm place. He will arrange transport Sunday or Monday with Colin.
