# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Nancy]
- All birds except Bano will be leaving the premises temporarily while barn ceiling is replaced.
- I have ordered more food.  Until it comes in please use mice in place of the small rats.
- I will be moving all of the birds inside the Barn to the Clinic tomorrow, 6/24. Johnson County Conservation will be replacing the ceiling in the Ransom cage at the Barn once the birds are moved.
- Bano will be the only bird left at the Barn.  Her cage is far enough from the Barn that she will be fine.
- (cm-Asio:: Asio will be transferred to Muscatine County Conservation this week.)
