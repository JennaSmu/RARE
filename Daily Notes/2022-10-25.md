# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Finder of BAEA HBC in Kossuth County, north of Algona. Caller (John) was desperate trying to get ahold of someone to help this BAEA. which he thinks was hit Sunday night and was still there today. He tried everyone he could think of including DNR, conservation, law authorities and even 2 TV stations and no one would help him. I called him and got his voice mail.  Left a message to call Kay at SOAR as she is closer and might know someone. After I left message with him I called Kay and she was aware but didn’t have details. I gave her location and caller’s information. Luckily she has a volunteer that is in that direction (Humboldt) and was going to coordinate.  Important FYI for future reference is that the vet in Algona will hold birds until SOAR can arrange transport. There are no listed rehabbers in that county or any surrounding counties on any list that I could find.
