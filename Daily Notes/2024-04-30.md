# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- 2 calls on baby BDOWs on ground. One was from Libertyville and the other from Brighton. Both callers said parents were near. Gave advice on normal behavior, makeshift nests, observing to see if obviously injured. 
- Kathy here, accidentally picked up the phone while working with electrician. Caller was Karen Hurt, Iowa City, injured Great Blue Heron in her yard. Gave her Dr Jana’s number. Dr Jana said yes if heron could be caught. Hurt called back and asked for help catching. House was close so I took the catch net and a large box. To my shock, we actually caught it. Returned catch net.  (Dawn: thank you so much for doing that, Kathy!  Just a reminder to ALWAYS wear eye protection with large waterfowl with those long strong beaks!!!!  Swim goggles work if you don’t have safety goggles at home.)
- Injured baby bunny in IC, referred to Suzanne.
