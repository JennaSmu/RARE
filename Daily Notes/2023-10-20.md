# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Kim]
- I heard a wild BDOW while I was cleaning, but never saw it. Might be the same one from the Spring.
- I pulled mice for tomorrow and they were pretty big, but still smaller than the small rats. We might not need as many as I pulled due to their size.

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Caller in Fairfield has 2 baby squirrels that he has been raising for the last month.  Now they are getting ornery and he wants to get them to a rehabber.  I told him he should have found a rehabber a month ago.  Referred him to Jodi Rigler.
