# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Fledgling pigeon on ground.  Advised her to put it back, she indicated there were cars around.  I referred her to Dr Jana.
- Baby turkey, only one left alive in the nest.  Wanted to raise it with his chickens, I advised that was illegal. Asked him to put it back and see if the parents returned.  Also gave Dr Jana’s number.
