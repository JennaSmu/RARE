# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Phyllis, Eldridge, IA finder of #2508 BDOW called to ask how bird was doing. Explained that owl was humanely euthanized on Feb 3. She thanked RARE. 
- AMKE injured in Davenport, IA. Caller put in box but could not transport. RARE supporter in Muscatine drove to Quad Cities, got bird, drove to IC and handed off to Luke. (It Takes a Village.) I think it will be AMKE #2511. Appears to have lacerations on wing and chest.
