| Barn     | Ladder ramp for high perch | Changed the eagles ladder ramp to the high perch.  We now have the ladder ramp on the perch closest to the door.  While we were there she tried to fly to the perch by the window on her own.  YAY!!! | Done           |                   |
| Barn     | Cooler                     | Found the cooler that we put the food in last summer when it was crazy hot.  Erin reminded me that we also pulled directly from the freezer.                                                          | Done           |                   |
| Barn     | Trash                      | Cleaned all of the trash out of the freezer.  If anyone has grocery bags we can use them at the barn and the clinic.                                                                                  | Done           |                   |

| Barn     | Gnats and flies            | PLEASE PLEASE keep an eye on all of the birds.  The little black gnats or flies have hatched and we need to make sure they aren’t in the birds eyes.                                                  | Keep an eye on |                   |
