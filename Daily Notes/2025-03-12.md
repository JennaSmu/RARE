# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Call from a man in Riverside regarding a Blue Heron on his property that he thought might be injured because it wasn’t moving around much.  When Connie returned his call it was still there but had moved to a different location.  Connie explained that we only work with raptors and gave him the numbers for the Washington County DNR and Wildlife Conservation offices. Also thanked him for his concern and reminded him that he can call us if he ever has concerns about a raptor.
- Misc: Connie contacted IC Animal Center on RTHA and paper work completed
