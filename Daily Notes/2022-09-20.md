# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Nancy, Seth]
- When I arrived at the barn, a furry animal scurried out the side door.  All I saw was a black, furry tail.  Not a cat.  Do skunks have black tails? I saw a ground hog near the building today too.

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Ben, IA DNR Wild Cat Den, Muscatine.  He picked up an injured RTHA.  When I returned call he told me that he was driving to IC this morning to clinic and it had passed before he got here.  He said they were going to keep it to use for education.
