# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Crow - Cedar Rapids - it had passed by the time I called them back.  
- Mike Murphy’s daughter found an EASO last night on the side of the road near their house at 1820 315th St. Brighton, IA 52540.  It did fly up about 6 ft, but that was all.  They thought it might just be cold and wet, so they put it in a box overnight.  This morning, they opened the box, and it still didn’t fly away.  There is a balcony on the 2nd floor of his house and a 2 car garage.  Zach Rosnith of Washington Co Conservation is bringing it to clinic tomorrow.
