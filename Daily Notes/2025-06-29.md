# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::Zim]
- Injured eagle in Marion, called and left a message but haven't heard back yet. 
- Baby bunnies, referred. 
- Matt from Waterloo, called yesterday evening about a RTHA hopping on the ground, but wasn't sure if it was injured (he saw no visible injury) or just a fledgling, and wanted the number to a local rehabber. I called back and left a message, said it could be learning how to fly but if it started showing signs of distress he could call Blackhawk and gave him the number.  He called me back and left a nasty voicemail. Said he worked on the Osprey project and he knew what he was doing (this confused me because I never said he didn't), told me I needed to work on my terminology, because I said bouncing around instead of hopping around in my message, and then proceeded to list everything wrong with the bird and how Terese was going to nurse it back to health, as if I was refusing to help the bird directly when he requested a rehabber in his area. I have since blocked his number on my phone for my own peace of mind.
