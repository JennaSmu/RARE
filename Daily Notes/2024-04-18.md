# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Colin, Kathy]
- Kathy was hard at work cleaning when I got to clinic. Kudos! Got rid of a lot of the boxes on top of cages and some of the plastic tupperware by the food/water bowls (in recycling).

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Several calls about a baby BDOW at the field house on U of I campus. I went out and worked with them to get it back up in the tree. Landscape dept came with a bucket truck. 2 other babies branching in tree. Did not see the nest, but both parents were nearby. I informed them that it (or its siblings) would likely be on the ground again in the near future, and to just leave them be if so. They put up signs to leave it be and don't get too close, as it’s a very busy part of campus.
- Call about an owl with broken wing. Finders husband says he thinks he saw bone. Let Jeanine know so she can coordinate for tomorrow.
