# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- JC Dispatch responded to a report of a hawk seen on I-380, it was deceased when they found it.
- Juv RTHA in Solon, I didn’t think it was injured so advised caller to let it be.
- Kierra Ages - found 3 birds in her laundry room on Johnson St. in IC, 1 escaped, animal control picked them up the other 2 at 12:30, but I don’t know what happened to them.  No one called us after picking them up, and I called JC Dispatch, and they said the report says closed.
- Patreese Pishney - CR, bird hit something and was very injured, died
- Nestling on sidewalk, died
- Devon from IC animal shelter brought in a juv BDOW. Devon sent me a photo & I explained what to look for on the bird to check for injuries. Devon didn’t find any, so I asked her to put it back where it came from. Beth Lainson called while I was at clinic to say that Devon released the BDOW in her yard but she didn't think that’s where it came from. Erin was the person who originally animal control. Erin said the BDOW came from a very tall maple or oak tree in front of 717 S 7th Ave in the space between the road & sidewalk. I told Beth but she didn't respond. Emily called @ 8:45 pm & reported the BDOW in that tree with an adult - she could see it from her place. I explained that it's not injured & will be walking around for awhile before it can fly.
- Brian - some kind of bird (he was not sure if it was a raptor) near Sugar Bottom, ran away
- Mika - fledgling in IC, didn’t think it was injured, so told her to put it back outside & keep dogs/cats away.
