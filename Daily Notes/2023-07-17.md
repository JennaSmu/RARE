# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Sandy Grey’s daughter picked a hawk up out of the middle of the road and took it to the Iowa Raptor Project.  The bird punctured the daughter’s arm, so they went to a doctor. Iowa Raptor Project staff drove the hawk to clinic but didn’t call first, so no one was there.  Then, they eventually took it to Wildthunder.  
- Mike called about a robin in Fairfield.  I left a voicemail but he didn’t call back.
- Hawk hit a window at 2918 Industrial Park Rd, they couldn’t find it when I called back.
- James stepped on a rabbit in Oskaloosa.
- Squirrel with bulging eye in Muscatine.
- Lisa Cleve from Teske’s in Bettendorf thought there was a peregrine falcon in the fenced in area behind the store.  She had already left, so we decided to leave him alone overnight and open the fence in the morning if he was still there.  Went to Tamara.
- Kim, nestling, Bettendorf - renested.
- Julie was concerned about a RTHA flying in her yard in Hiawatha but not eating all of her neighbor’s domestic ducklings (only one and only the head) and being mobbed by robins.  I said he didn’t need help and suggested leaving the prey out a bit longer instead of removing it right away.
