# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Iowa City, Injured pelican south of Highway 6 on Iowa River. Assume this is the same one that we’ve received numerous calls about since spring. Gave the phone number of Erika and also Tracy at Wildthunder.
- Report of injured hawk on side of road just past Swisher exit on southbound I380.  Sonja will look tomorrow when passing by. We also got a call on this bird yesterday at 6:27 pm.
- Mt. Vernon, finder has a [23117 COHA](../RARE%20Birds/23117%20COHA.md) on their property that was found yesterday. Laying on the ground with wing up flapping. When I returned the call she said she had also called Tracy and was waiting to hear back from her on rescuing.
	- I have the [23117 COHA](../RARE%20Birds/23117%20COHA.md) from MT Vernon - Will pick up from Jana Klein tomorrow on my way down to the clinic.
- Clinton, finder has an owl in a box that he picked up in his cattle pasture.  I gave him Lyndsi Frahms number in Clinton. Lyndsi never got back to him. He called me back and said the owl had passed.
