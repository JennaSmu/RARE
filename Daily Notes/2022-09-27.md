# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Injured female cardinal from window strike (on phone from last evening).  Bird had passed overnight.  
- Possum from Jefferson County. Caller had it in the house since it was a baby. It was getting too big for the house and they wanted to rehome it. I told her how wrong it was to keep any type of wildlife and gave her Jodi Rigler’s info.
- Injured baby squirrel in Iowa City.  Referred to Suzanne.
- Zach from Washington County has GHOW with leg injury.  Bringing to clinic tomorrow.
