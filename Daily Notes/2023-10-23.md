# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Colin]
- I brought my handheld vacuum in. It is on the desk near the front door, and works nicely to clean up killy’s turf if it isn't caked in fresh poop. Feel free to use it for whatever while it’s here. I’ll take it home eventually. I bet it works great for rogue feathers!
- Took 2 bags of deluxe cardinal blend, and 1 bag of black oil sunflower seeds. $75 check from nahant marsh left on the clip on the desk by the front door, and $40 paid by me via the “donate” feature on our website.
- Still had music next door almost the entire time I was at clinic. Not too loud, but I could hear it.

>> [!Medical]+
>> ##### 🩺Caregiving:
>> - Put some folded newspaper underneath his flat wood perch, so hopefully his nice new turf doesn't get poopy too fast.
>> - Propped up his big stick slightly, and added a couple perches so he can maneuver around the cage nicely.
>>
>>##### 🫧 Clean:
>> - Scrubbed poop off current turf, hung it up to dry, and added the other black turf that was there.
>>
>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - Window time.
>> - He seemed to enjoy the new perches, and I saw him on all but one of the perches while I was at clinic.

# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Colin]
- If pulling the jumbo mice (I think they’re actually baby rats), only pull 2 for birds that would usually get 3 mice. Try to use the normal sized mice for Asio if possible.

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Call about a bat hanging from building at eye level in IA City, no obvious injuries. She said Wildthunder and Blackhawk are too far for her. Informed her that they are the only places near here that take in bats, and that if it doesn’t appear visibly injured, to leave it be and contact someone if it is still there tomorrow.
- Call about another bat in someone’s house in bettendorf. They already contained it. Informed to put vertically on tree outside if not injured, otherwise referred to wildthunder.
