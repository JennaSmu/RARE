>> - #🦅🩺-bird-care/short-term We put a new nest box up in Bano’s cage.  This box is an open box.  It is behind the door.  At this time her old box is still in the cage and will be removed in a couple of weeks.  If she is in the new box please give her privacy.  If she postures and hisses, give her space, this means she is uncomfortable with your closeness.
