## [2359 COHA](../RARE%20Birds/2359%20COHA.md):
> [!multi-column]+
>
>> [!notice]
>> ##### 🗨️Comments:
>> - This bird is an accipiter not a buteo(Bwha). Very confusing for sure! Reminder on how to tell them apart, Accipiters have a purple oral cavity, have a long 3rd digit with a nub on the underside of the 3rd toe and have a streamlined body. Sharp shinned hawks have a squared off tail, Cohas have a rounded tail tip.  Buteos have a robust body, Pink oral cavity, the toes are smaller and probably one of the birds RARE admits frequently.
