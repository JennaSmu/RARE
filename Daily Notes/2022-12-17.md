# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Colin, Elana]
- Did some tidying up in the office area. Condensed all the stuff that was taped on the wall by the phone to a bulletin board in same spot. Bano’s travel box is in the education cabinet. The stuff on top of the “quarantine” cages is stuff we found that we could possibly put up as interpretive material… will go through it another time. There were 4 boxes of donated newspaper at the door when I arrived.  Put it inside the bench by the door (it is like a trunk and the seat opens) as there is not much room for it elsewhere!
- If there is anything you cannot find that was originally in the office area, please contact Colin or Elana.
