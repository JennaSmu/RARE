# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Elana, Jay]
- Which size nitrile gloves do we need? We need Medium at clinic. I found a box of one size fits most when I was looking for Mediums so got those out. Couldn’t find any other boxes of Mediums over by the computer area, under the counter where extra boxes of other sizes were stashed.
