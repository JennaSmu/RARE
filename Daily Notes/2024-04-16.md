# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- IC, Finder was concerned about an owl that had been seen around the Fieldhouse for the last few days. I checked it out.  It’s a mature BDOW that was in the trees in front by the entrance.  It flew several times between trees while I was there and also went after two crows that were harassing it.  I called the finder back and told him it appeared fine and was acting normal.
- IC, report of an injured goose by UIHC.  I called back several times, no answer and her voice mail was not set up to leave a message.
- Two calls on injured baby rabbits. One was from Walcott and the other was a local construction site that had destroyed the nest. Referred.
- Jacob Wilbourne, Cedar County Conservation about BDOW at barn.  He talked with Sonja and they’ve made arrangements for Friday.
