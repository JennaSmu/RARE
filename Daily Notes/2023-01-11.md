# 📞Calls:

- Follow up on the owl locked in the new addition at Pleasantview in Kalona.  I called this morning and was told the owl was still there.  I drove down and we searched the entire building and could not locate.  The building addition is huge and is in the framing stage with walls but has several cracks around vents and small areas open to the outside. After I got down there they told me they saw it yesterday but hadn’t seen it yet today so I’m assuming it found a way out last night. They will notify us if they see it again.
