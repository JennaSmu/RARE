# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Kathy, Jodeane]
- Please make sure everyone is putting down at least 2 layers of newspaper on all of the bottom of the clean cages.  You can use colored newspaper, just not the shiny, slippery ads.  You can use half sheets, but please put them on the bottom and cover small pieces with a full sheet on top.  2 half sheets and 2 full sheets are enough.
- The music and bass beats were very loud at 12:30 PM. Jodeane spoke to them at 2:00. Got a little quieter.If having problems with music, please text Elana. She is now our point person. 847 769 0322. Please copy and repaste.
- Removed and clean above bathroom. Kathy will take empty plastic carriers to PAWS & More and It Takes A Village (animal shelter).
- Cleaned filter in minisplit.
