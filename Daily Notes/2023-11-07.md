# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Dawn, Susan, Jodeane]
- Music was a bit loud when we at 11:15 am, overall volume got lower maybe 11:45 but bass still bothersome, then was quiet for maybe an hr, volume increased with bass along N wall but not as bad in exam area, texted Elana.
- Susan put a couple of tail sheaths that she laminated in the tail sheath bin, one is currently on the NOHA.  If we like them, she can make some more.

>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - This guy is extremely jumpy and stressed, open mouthed breathing. I think the perch he was on was way too tall, and I’m wondering if he isn’t eating on his own because he can’t reach down from the perch to get the food
