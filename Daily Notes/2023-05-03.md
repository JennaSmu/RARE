>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - At Sonja’s advice, I placed [2322 GHOW](../RARE%20Birds/2322%20GHOW.md) into the left side in the cardboard box, and opened it, with mice on the stump.  I went back about 10 min later and carefully peeked in on them. Tiny 2322 was still in his box and [2326 GHOW](../RARE%20Birds/2326%20GHOW.md) was very calm and perching. 

# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Kim]
- Gave a deluxe raking and cleaning of Ransom Cage, since it’s empty.  Scrubbed the big water bowl and hung upside down on the post in the cage.

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Got 2 different calls about a RTHA in Hiawatha on the corner of N Center Pointe and Tower Terrace area.  Last night at 8:30pm was walking and struggling to fly, but when approached by the finder, flew up about 6 feet into a tree.  Second caller this afternoon said that they saw in the same area in some bushes near CCB packaging.  Maybe we can try to get him if we get any more calls, since it sounds like it’s staying in that area.
