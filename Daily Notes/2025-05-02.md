# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Brooklyn in CR called about newborn songbirds who had fallen out of their nest. Nest was mostly destroyed. Referred to Dr Jana.
- Donna in Lake Delhi called about injured Blue Jay. Referred to Wild Thunder.
- Crystal called about opportunities to use VTO to volunteer for a day. Called her back to let her know that we can’t do a one-time volunteer event/day, and if RARE is somewhere she’d be interested in volunteering with long term for more than a single event, she can submit the normal volunteer application.
