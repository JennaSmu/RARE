>>- It is one of the HY from the nest box on the MidAmerican building in downtown davenport.
>>- I took it back to MidAmerican and placed in the nest box before coming to clinic. I have a contact at midamerican that can give me access to the nest box. Please contact me if needed. The 3 babies from the nest box are all fledged and old enough now where they should be left alone if uninjured.
