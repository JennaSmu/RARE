>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - Had a barn incident with the [2325 BDOW](../RARE%20Birds/2325%20BDOW.md) and the wild owl, there was a small space in barn that the wild owl caught the BDOW by the wing.
>> - Alicia came and helped get the wild owl out while I looked over the BDOW. She wasn't moving her wing and was shaking, so I brought her back to the clinic to be checked over.
>> - Alicia fixed the hole. Alicia needs a raise.
