# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- 3 songbirds out of nests, advised how to make a makeshift nest.  
- Ducks nesting at City High in a courtyard area.  One baby died, mom still sitting on the nest.  Advised they couldn’t move the nest, but gave Dr Jana’s number for additional advise, especially on getting them to water once they all hatched
- Baby racoon in Washington, referred to rehabber in Wellman. 
- Deer sitting just off the road, appeared to have possibly been hit or stunned.  Advised no rehabber could take in deer.  He could call the DNR or wait to see if it took off.
