# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Colin, Halie]
- Halie swept clinic floors.
- Music was VERY loud and bass-y today. They were playing metal music the entire time. Lots of weights being dropped. I can hear every word of every song clearly as I am typing these notes. It honestly seems louder today than I’ve heard it to date.

>> - Took for x-rays. No fx found. Bruise on L wrist is totally gone.
>> - Left wrap off per Dr. E.
>> - The x-ray didn't show legs very well due to positioning on the x-ray table (my bad), but he is using both of them just fine and they both seem strong.
