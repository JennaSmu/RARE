> - [ ] #⚠️-attention I also left some head lamps and a lantern.  (I forgot the batteries for the lantern). With the new ceiling it can be shadowy and dark in the ransom cage if the sun’s not out.  These could help.
> - [ ] #⚠️-attention We are out of small rats.

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Burlington, Evan Smith (319-850-1330) Juvenile RTHA got into their chicken coop last evening. It killed and ate a chicken and scuffled with roosters. When she got it out of there to release it, it couldn’t fly. She kept it in a kennel overnight and it was in worse condition this morning. Amanda picked it up today and will bring it to the clinic tomorrow.
