# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Iowa City, baby bunny, cat had brought home. Referred.
- Iowa City, Deceased BDOW found under utility pole. I went by on my way to clinic and picked it up. It appeared to have struck the power lines/pole and likely died of  head trauma. Blood coming out of the oral cavity and eye damage. Utility pole was a junction of several lines and electrical equipment. It still had its prey clutched in talons, a baby bunny. I took it to clinic, labeled it and put it in the freezer for proper disposal.
- Davenport, baby bird, couldn’t locate nest. Referred to Dr. Jana. Finder willing to transport today.
