# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- North Liberty, baby squirrel, referred to Suzanne. 
- DeWitt, young hawk on ground in fenced in backyard. Finder also called Blackhawk and they told her to put in box and they would get back to her but they hadn’t yet when I called her.  I told her not to put the bird in a box if it was uninjured and in a protected space as the parents will care for it.  I told her to observe from afar.  She said it didn’t appear to be injured and she thought the nest was in a neighbors tree.
- Iowa City, finder thought a fledgling hawk might be injured in Wetherby park as it was on the ground but was flying short distances. I checked out as it was on east side of IC but couldn’t locate the bird. 
- Cedar Rapids, baby bird blown out of nest last night, finder had in house, referred to Dr. Jana.
