# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Goose with injured foot in Burlington - referred.  She had already called most of the names I gave her.
- Warehouse in Burlington has a hawk in it.  They have tried opening the doors and that isn’t working.  On Friday they only have office staff, so they will open all of the warehouse doors, without all the activity fingers crossed it will take off.
- Red headed wood pecker hit window.  It had flown off by the time I called back.
