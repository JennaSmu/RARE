# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Several phone calls- GHOW in Burlington. Amanda will work to pick up. Perhaps Friday folks can meet her halfway.
- Calls on ducks/Geese and songbirds all dealt with.
- Calls may be active after fireworks tonight. Keep your dogs home and hope the wildlife can handle things.
