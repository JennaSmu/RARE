>>##### 🩺Caregiving:
>> - Cleaned dry dirt blocking nostrils.
>> - [ ] #🦅🩺-bird-care/short-term Please check him first thing when you arrive to see if he ate any of the quail left today (we cut a small piece out of the chest is all) and is BAR or flying.  If so, continue meds as prescribed on med sheet and don’t give Metacam.  However, if his crop is still full from today and he hasn’t touched the food we gave Sat, he might have a crop infection, in which case please contact me or Sonja to determine the procedure. 
>> - [ ] #🦅🩺-bird-care/short-term Put a towel over his cage to minimize stress while cleaning the BAEA’s cage, please.
>>
>>##### 🫧 Clean:

>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - Did not move when I went to grab him and was wobbly and lethargic - did not fly, did not try to escape
>> - Crop was very full.
>> 	- Maybe had just eaten but could also indicate a crop infection.
>> 	- #🦅🩺-bird-care/short-term Please report whether he ate or crop went down to help determine if there is an infection.

>> - Flew HP-HP 3x.
>> - Tried to get to HP once but didn't grasp and ending up falling on the ground.
>> - Release notes:
>> 	- Picked up and drove to Crawfordsville where we met with the finder and his family for the release.  107 had other ideas, she had gotten one side of the box open and as I was removing the box from my car she decided that she was going NOW!  She flew about 10 feet and then sat & watched us.  It took her a bit to get herself oriented before she took off and flew across the field.

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Finder in Davis County had a snow junco for a week, and its entire wing fell off but was somehow not bleeding and lively.  Dr. Jana said put it outside.  Asked World Bird Sanctuary, Niabi Zoo, & Tracy if they wanted an educational bird.  Still trying to find a place for it to be euthanized.  Injured squirrel in JC - referred to Suzanne Hoofnagle.  
- 4 pm Hawk (photos below) with 1 wing that was bent at crooked angle (not sure if there is an eye injury or just glare in photo) on southbound side of hwy.  Start looking at the intersection of US 218 & 192nd St. in the L southbound lane and get into the L lane.  He was 8-10 ft into the median.  If you get to the highway patrol turnaround, you’ve gone too far.  Barb Davis & her husband, (319) 209-1528, can be called with questions.  They tried to catch it but couldn’t and had dogs in their car.  They live in Burlington, so won’t be going back that way.  Jeanine or Kathy will look for him tomorrow.
