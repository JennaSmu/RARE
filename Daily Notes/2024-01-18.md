# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Colin]
- There will not be birds in the corn crib until Sunday. No need to trek through the snow down there! Bano is the only non-barn bird that needs cared for.
- I did not clean or collect pellets, as the snow was already coming down pretty hard and I wanted to make sure I could get out of the driveway, and that Denali and Asio had a safe trip back with me. Lane was driveable in my Honda accord, but be cautious with the new snow falling tonight. All locks worked while I was there.
