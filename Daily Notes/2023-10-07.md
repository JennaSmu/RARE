# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Sonja, Jodeane]
- We had 2 students and 1 teacher visiting from Ellesworth Community college for a class on Rehab., etc. 
- I am working with our new neighbors to come to some sort of compromise on the music. So bear with it please. We definitely Have our three parking spots out front 29A. We can use the areas between the two downspouts. Ignore the lines. If we need more parking please find something open opposite the bldg. Please be patient as we work with our new neighbors. So far they are somewhat friendly.
- A reminder to those who are teaching new volunteers, Please fill out the log book about what they are learning. Thanks
