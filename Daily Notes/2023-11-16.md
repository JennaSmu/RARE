# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Denise, Nancy]
- Music was obnoxious but got quiet by the time I left.  Glad the decibel meter is in place.
- At this time we are no longer in need of blankets, towels, small cleaning towels, scrubs or Pet taxis. If someone brings a bird in a pet taxi please remove bird and give the pet taxi back to the finder. We have cardboard pet taxis located by Anesthesia machine. I would prefer you use those for you to transport to and from injury site or to and from barn/clinic. If sending a bird to release please use boxes on top of cage. They are free the others cost RARE money. Please don’t let boxes build up at barn. Recycle or bring back to clinic. Some are needed at barn for transport purposes. We have installed a decibel monitor at 29A to track noise. Please do not move. You are all doing a fabulous job keeping the birds healthy and safe. Please know you are all appreciated. We also have bird seed available again.
- Colin, have you got anything in the works for giving Tuesday? Also please contact KathyJanz about some ideas for fundraising she has. Please update our wants and needs on the website/FB. Anyone think of anything?
- Yes, I have a fb post planned for 1 week prior, and there will be an email to our mailchimp list and fb fundraiser with a few posts on the actual day. I am hoping to have this year's calendar made by then that we can promote as an alternative to a standard donation as well.

# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Alicia]
- At this time I (Sonja) have the heater in the barn unplugged.  We are looking at alternative solutions for thawing the food in the winter.  Please do not plug it in.  I hope to have something set up by next week before it cools down to much.

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- One call for Jodeane from one of the finders of [23121 BDOW](../RARE%20Birds/23121%20BDOW.md).  She had been notified that the bird had been euthanized but wanted Jodeane to talk to the other finder. Jodeane called and talked to her.
