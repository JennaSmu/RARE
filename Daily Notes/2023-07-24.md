# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Sonja, Dawn, Susan]
- The AC unit at the clinic was leaking on Friday.  At that time I put a bucket under it and JC looked at it on Saturday.  Today Ryan came in and worked on it and it doesn’t appear to be leaking anymore.  I left the bucket under the unit, I did not put the furniture back yet.  (From Dawn:) I emptied the green bucket before we left clinic, so if there’s any water in it tomorrow, it was from after 5 pm.  The metal bowl was empty as well.
- The last 4 eagles have been sent to NER.

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Calls: You can erase the messages from Jay West from Mt. Vernon and the lady with the bird that got picked up by animal control in Waterloo.  I’m assuming it went to Blackhawk, or that we would have had a message from their animal control.  
- I’m sorry, I forgot to call the lady about the bunny.  
- Remember to start checking if birds that people call “hawks” are really nighthawks. I ask them for a photo or show them a picture of a nighthawk and some kind of hawk and ask which picture the bird looks more like.
