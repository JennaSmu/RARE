# 🏥Clinic:

- Music is still VERY loud from the new gym next door. I could clearly hear all lyrics and feel the bass to every song played. There was one car parked in our 3rd spot when I arrived, and a different car parked there when I left. If the parking issue persists, I suggest we get a sign that warns that unauthorized parking will lead to towing at owner's expense - if our building will allow it. Nahant Marsh gets signs made from “Iowa prison industries” and they are relatively inexpensive, and good quality.
