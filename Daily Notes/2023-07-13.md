# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Phone wasn't ringing yesterday, so 7 calls:
- 2 calss about an injured hawk or falcon around Bettendorf Public Library, called library and they hadn't seen anything (maybe a fledgling?)
- Injured COHA, DNR officer dropped off yesterday
- Young pigeon on side of highway, finder had released and it flew away okay
- Newly hatched baby bird out of nest, finder did not leave a phone number to call back; guy called and left a message asking if we were interested in having a booth at an open house he was going to have, details sent to Elana. 
- Hawk that hit a window, called back and it had passed away
- Sharp-shinned hawk on ground in Iowa city, called back and it had passed away - the finder called Johnson County Conservation because there were also three dead crows within the same area the hawk was so he was concerned about poisoning or avian influenza - he collected their bodies for testing
- Baby hawk caught by cat, turned out to be a fledgling robin - there were no injuries so she put it back outside with the parents and is going to keep her cat inside
- Possible injured vulture along Mormon Trek, finder had her toddler with her so didn't stop - we went to the location she specified and did not see anything.
