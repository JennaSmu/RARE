# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- From Alexis from Central City regarding AMKE HY. Dana picked up and brought to clinic. 
- Call from Aaron in Cedar Rapids - HY RTHA at Profol at 4333 C St.  Bird was under a car, by the time I got up there most of the cars were gone.  I observed one of the parents calling from a tree close by.  No sign of the fledgling.
