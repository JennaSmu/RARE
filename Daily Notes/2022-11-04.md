>> ##### 💥Significant Event:
>> - (se-22109-RTHA:: 😭 Euthanized)
>>
>> ##### 🗨️Comments:
>> - Unfortunately, his eye’s functioning didn’t improve, and we believed that he would injure himself or starve in the wild with only 1 eye. 
>> - Owls can rely on their sense of hearing if they are missing an eye, but hawks can’t.  We humanely euthanized him and spoke to the finder on the phone.

>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - We saw a flat fly while this bird was on the table, but we weren’t sure where it came from.  We spritzed the gloves we used with Rescue.
