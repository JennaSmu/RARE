# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Johnson County dispatch called this morning to share a report of an injured owl in the median of 80 E by mile marker 233. I asked someone if he would try to pick it up, but they said no. He did say also that he had driven by there and didn't see anything, though. 
- Madison found a baby bird, left voice message. 
- Raccoon dragging back legs by IC animal shelter, picked up.
