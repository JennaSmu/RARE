- There were more plastic bags hiding in box in food cabinet.  No surgical gloves that I could find, but I left a few plastic gloves that I had in my car.  They are in the fridge.  Better than nothing!

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- 10:43 Briana in Bedford (SW Iowa) injured turkey vulture. DNR caught and Iowa Bird Rehabilation is working with bird.
- Alex in Davenport “captured” an orphan duckling. No one in Davenport would take. I suggested finding a flock of baby ducklings and let his join the group.
