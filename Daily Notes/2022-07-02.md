# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Uninjured nestling on ground in Coralville - renested.
- A woman in North Liberty who bought an outdoor playset from someone else found a nest with babies in it and an adult dead from being tangled in string that the nest was made with.  She said the seller would be hostile to taking the nest back there (even with one adult dead, the other one should take over caring for the young).  I offered to talk to the seller or try to find a foster parent for the babies and gave her Dr. Jana’s #.  She didn’t call back.
- Uninjured nestling - renested, can’t remember where.
