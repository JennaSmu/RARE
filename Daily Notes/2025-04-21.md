>>##### 🗨️ Comments:
>>- This bird was found on the ground in Bloomfield at finders work, noticed on Friday and they watched all day for parents.  Finder lives in Webster, when they didn’t see parents she took bird home with her.  Advised to put in nest or create a new box for the bird.  After several tries to find someone to help put bird back in nest, or create a new box she decided (Sunday) that she couldn’t do it.

>> ##### 🗨️ Treatment Comments:
>> - At that point we started looking for a new nest. One was found late Sunday, bird was transported to Elana and I picked up and transported to a surrogate nest.
