# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Don White wanted to know if RARE provided assistance or funding to help property owners set up raptor friendly habitats, like CRP. I directed him to his county conservation office or the DNR.
- Mac took a call regarding an owl along the road.  He went to check it out and was unable to locate the owl.
