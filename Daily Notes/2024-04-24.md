# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Jodeane, Dana, Kathy]
- Misc: Jodeane brought mealworms. They are in animal supply refridge. Also, crickets in barnlike carrier. Importantly: the isofluorine and oxygen were left on by last user. We refilled the isofluorine. Unfortunately: despite heroic efforts by Jodeane, sink still leaks. Some cross-thread issues and 4 one-mL syringes found in J-bend of sink. (We shut off water and took sink apart, we’re surprised to find the syringes. Check sink carefully and use that mesh screen in drain.)
