# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Dawn, Susan]
- Music was way too loud music most of time we were there, it sounded like it was coming from both the wall north of us and the wall east of us at different times.  Sometimes it was louder than others.  There were also about 5 loud crashing noises that sounded like weights were being dropped on the floor.  Jodeane stopped by to talk to Steve about it.  I don’t know the outcome.  No smell.

# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Sonja]
- I swept off the ledges in the barn and the feathers in the corn crib.  Raked cages and office area. 
- All items on the desk in the barn have been put inside the desk.  I will be moving the fans up to the loft in the barn & and covering with a tarp.
