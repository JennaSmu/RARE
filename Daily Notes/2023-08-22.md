# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Dawn, Susan]
- I can’t get Colin’s laptop to connect to the network.  Our AT&T Wifi 2397 network was not on the list of available networks.  Tried adding 2397 as the name of a network, but it wouldn’t connect.  Had the same problem on 8/13/23.  Any ideas? When I was there, the hotspot device by the window would not turn on. So I think it’s a problem with the hotspot. I meant to note that on monday but forgot. -Colin
