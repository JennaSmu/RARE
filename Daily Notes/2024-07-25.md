# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Amanda, Dana, Sonja]

> [!info]-
> - #⚠️-attention Music next door got loud part of the way through while feeding eagle.
> - #⚠️-attention I took 100 mice, 30 small rats & 10 jumbo rats to the barn.  Dana took out quail but she took them back to the clinic because of the COHA that we have at the clinic.  I apologize for not letting you (Dana) know prior to that.  I will get Quail ordered next week.  
> - #⚠️-attention Please when washing clothes; 1. unroll any rolly beds that were made for the birds prior to putting in the washer. 2.  Do not overload the washer. 3. Please wash on Normal cycle (instead of Heavy Duty.) at this time the washer is stopping on a spin cycle when on the Heavy Duty cycle.
