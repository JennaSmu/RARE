# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Colin]

- [comments:: Luke stated that the black flies are back, so please keep an eye on him.  Look for redness around eye, labored breathing, abnormal behavior, etc, and if you notice these things, notify one of our licensed rehabbers immediately.  We may not be able to run an extension cord for the fans down to the corn crib due to JCC, so we need to add the rechargeable bug zappers back to Asio’s cage.  2 of them should go in his cage and be changed out daily.]
- [comments::Please make sure you’re checking for and removing pellets in each cage.  There were (at least) 5 pellets in each of the smaller barn cages today and 3 pellets in Asios cage.]

>> ##### 🗨️Comments:
>> - Make sure to work this bird daily. Want to get them to fly to wall, climb back up to HP, and fly one more time while you’re there. 
>> - He should readily fly if you walk under him and make some noise (clapping, using your voice, etc).  If he wont budge, use a broom/rake to gently encourage him.
>> - If you notice he is mouth breathing, give him a break while you tend to the other birds and come back to him.
>> - If he makes it HP-HP, make sure to note it on his chart. 
>> - This bird needs exercise for us to get a good idea of the possibility of release.]
