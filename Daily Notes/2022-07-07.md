# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::Dawn]
- Fledgling grackle kept inside by finder for few days because has outdoor cats they didn't want to bring in. Told to put in makeshift nest though it would keep getting out because its learning to fly. Caller was very adamant the cats would get it if it went back outside, and said the bird was getting used to being fed by them. Referred to Dr. Jana in case it got imprinted.
- North Liberty, fledgling robin with sticky residue on legs and feet causing them to stick together. Referred to Dr. Jana.
- Ft Madison area - Finder picked up a baby kestrel that she found in a bucket (Wednesday night).  She fed it hamburger, I asked her not to feed anymore.  Photo showed a baby boy.  She took it back to where she found it and put in a tree.
- Jose found a baby bird in front of restaurant, had feathers, trying to fly.  Put back up in tree.
- Caller had a nest of birds on her outdoor light, wanted us to come and remove them.  Advised her that she could not move it & that it was illegal to do so..  She was worried that the babies would fall out.  I advised making a makeshift nest.  She said she was just going to call her landlord.  Any chance this was at Concord Terrace (IC)?  They have been told MULTIPLE times that they are not allowed to move nests with eggs or offspring in them.  There is a resident there named Helga that keeps complaining about the birds pooping on the patio.  My friend used to live there and had a conversation with the manager and someone from DNR, who told them very clearly they can place deterrents before eggs are laid, but not disturb the nest after eggs are laid.
