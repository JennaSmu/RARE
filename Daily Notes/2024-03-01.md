>> ##### 🩺Caregiving:
>> - We didn’t see any fx’s on xrays, but she was still bleeding. 
>> - We covered 3 small tears in the skin over the radius & ulna on the inside of the wing & 1 area with a section of deeper tears on the back of the wing with TAB ointment & Tegaderm, but then found another section of skin completely torn open right on the wrist on the back of the wing, and there wasn’t enough skin to suture it closed.

>> [!notice]
>> ##### 🗨️Comments:
>> - Please do not get her out of the cage or pick her up at all, clean with the divider only.  If she didn’t eat any of the rat from yesterday, you can try to HF while she is in the cage, if you’re comfortable with that.  You can try with the door open if she’s calm, but if she’s jumping around and aggressively biting, you can just put the hemostats through the bars of the cage with the doors closed and see if she will eat that way.

>> ##### 🩺Caregiving:
>> - Xrays showed lower humerus bone distended outward but not through skin. 
>> - Dr. E was not available for surgery this weekend, so she said we can try to wrap & splint.
>> - So we used a 6 in. ruler to splint over a maxi pad, under anesthesia, and wrapped cotton gauze around wing to try to hold splint in place. 
>> - Put a Figure 8 wing wrap and body wrap with vet wrap on top of the gauze. 
>> - She was still a bit groggy from anesthesia when we left, so we gave a rolly bed till she wakes up completely on her own.  This can be removed tomorrow.

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Julia Bulecheck, (319) 530-8726 (caller id says Jason Bulecheck) was in a barn type structure last Sat on her property that is scheduled to be torn down when an owl (she thinks a GHOW) flew out of the structure from a nest near a ceiling fan, and she found 2 eggs.  She put the eggs in an incubator & 1 of them hatched (yesterday I think).  I called her last night and left a voicemail & she didn’t answer.  Sonja called her this morning.  She called me back at 11 am.  She had been feeding it small pieces of baby mice and it was chirping, & I thought I convinced her to make a nest and put the bird outside closest to where the parents were seen in the structure.  She asked if she should wait until evening, and I said no, the sooner the better.  I texted at 1:30 for an update with no answer then again at 6:23 asking if she made a nest & put it outside.  She said she just did 20 min. ago & was waiting to see what happened. Sonja & I are concerned that she might have lied & still be keeping the bird.  She has been told to put it outside.  f she calls again, be firm & repeat that she needs to put it outside & it’s illegal and not helpful to the bird if she is keeping it, or tell Sonja or I and we will contact her again.  Thanks!!
