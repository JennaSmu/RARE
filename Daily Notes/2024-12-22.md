# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Hawk hit glass deck railing in Urbandale - flew off by the time I called back (advised to catch it & get treated @ IBR if it happens again). 
- Individual from Marshalltown rescued a Canadian goose that they thought was freezing. Was concerned about having bird flu. Dawn referred them to their doctor and Ames Iowa Wildlife Center and Waterloo Blackhawk. 
- Goose probably needing euthanasia in Guttenburg - he called local police & I gave him the # for Wildthunder.
