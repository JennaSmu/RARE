>> - Officer Madol of North Liberty police picked this bird up from lying on the ground and put it in a pet carrier.  He said it was still breathing when he picked it up.  He gave me a ride and we dropped the bird off at clinic, but it was dead when I took it out of the carrier. I asked him if he saw any seizures or shaking and he said no.
