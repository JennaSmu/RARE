>> - In the wild, I believe adult GHOWs stockpile mice in their nests, and the babies free feed. If this little one eats the 1 m that I left in there today, we could probably reduce hand feeding?

>> ##### 💊 Meds:
>> - Forgot to give fluids until after I already fed, so did not give fluids today.
>>
>> ##### 🩺Caregiving:
>> - Moved to fresh box with warm buddy, towel, and puppet stretched over a stump.
>> - Played adult GHOW sounds on youtube as I was working with [2319 BAEA](../RARE%20Birds/2319%20BAEA.md) and [Bano](../RARE%20Birds/Ed%20Birds/Bano.md). 
>> - Also moved box to different cage. I may be overthinking it, but I assume the cages by the garage door get colder than the cages that are more on the interior of the building.
>>
>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - Ate very well.
