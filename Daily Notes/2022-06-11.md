# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Sonja, Colin]
- We need food at the barn, and also need hooks to add to the cages to hang the zappers on.  One zapper will also go in Rivers cage when she goes back out.  We also need plastic grocery bags for garbage and waste.  If you are doing barn and then clinic, if you wouldn’t mind taking garbage from the freezer to the dump bins at the clinic, it would be much appreciated.
