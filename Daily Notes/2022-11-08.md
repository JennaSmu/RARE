# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Possible injured hawk by Muscatine.  Caller (Jim) had seen it standing by the side of the highway and came back the same way 5 hours later and it was still standing in the same spot. He was going to attempt to capture.  I gave him Dave Bakke’s contact info.
- Possible injured hawk in Cedar Rapids. Caller saw it dive and hit the pavement and flew off and crash landed again.  She went to look for it but it flew into the woods. She left her contact info with people that lived nearby if they see it and she will try to rescue.
- RTHA inside screened porch in Marion. Caller (Jolene) said they leave the door open for their dog and a hawk flew in and couldn’t get out.  I told her how to herd it out as she was afraid to get near it.  She wasn’t very willing to take my advice so I told her to leave the door open and it may find its way out.
