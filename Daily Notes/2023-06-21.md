- Please do not use the steel brush in the cages. It scratches and rust will form. OK to use on floors though. Try using the drill and gold colored brushes. Get a little bit of warm soapy water, dip just the brush into it and turn on the drill. you don't have to push hard. If it looks like it scratches cages, please stop.
