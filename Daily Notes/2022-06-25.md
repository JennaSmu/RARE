# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Fledgling RTHA found in field last night (with a dead bunny) on finder’s property.  Placed in box overnight.  After discussion, no injuries found and RTHA BAR, hopping out of box, so finder placed back where found.
- Also RTHA HY found by another finder, who called Sonja with concern. No injuries noticed.  Finder notified Sonja that it flew away a few hours later.
