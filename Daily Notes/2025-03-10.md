# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Rock Island, BAEA HBC on Hwy 92. Her husband had spotted and called her to find help. When I called her back she was enroute to the eagle. Several people were pulled over. It appeared the BAEA was going for a roadkill hawk when it was hit. BAEA was deceased when she arrived. She told me someone had contacted USFW and they were coming to pick it up. I asked her to toss the roadkill hawk far from the highway.
- Davenport, Guy that works for a gutter company, had baby squirrels in a box that were displaced, referred.
