# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Call from Thursday night, small bird, found in the woods.  No location or call back number.
- Jess in IC, called about a pelican in the Iowa River below HWY 6.  He has been there all summer.  Referred.
- Call about an eagle down in a field by Newport.  When I called back the bird had flown off but she thought it looked like it was holding its foot oddly.  I told her to keep an eye out for it.
