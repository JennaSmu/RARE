# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Dan in Manchester had a duckling wander into his yard by itself.  He gave it to Cerro Gordo & said Jessica treats birds there.  Her name isn’t on the DNR list, but the phone # is.
- Travis inquired about becoming a mammal rehabber in Henry County, gave him the # for SE IA Rehab in Burlington.
- Gary Benning, a park ranger in New Liberty (near Dixon, IA), found a very friendly juvenile RTHA that had been locked in his shop since Sat.  He put it outside this morning, and it came back later in the afternoon.  He did not observe any injuries, and I didn’t either, from his photo & the questions I asked him, but I would have liked to fed it because it was very hot this weekend, and it hadn’t gotten any food in 3 days.  Unfortunately, he couldn’t bring it till after my ride was coming, and I was there by myself.  Colin was unavailable as well.  Gary thought he heard adults calling nearby, so I advised him to leave it outside and let its parents resume caring for it.  Update: the bird didn’t make it through the night.
- Michelle Stevens - HY BDOW near her son, no injuries observed, will keep an eye on it.  Update: she found this one deceased the next morning.
- Rick - baby raccoon in Solon, referred
- Victoria Burns - squirrel, she found someone
