# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- 2 calls about songbirds - referred out
- 1 call about a RTHA in West Liberty. Able to fly, but was perching on fence with one leg, holding up other. It is common for birds to hold one leg up while resting, so unless there were other signs of injury it is probably OK - (Colin) Hasn’t seen in a few hours. Since I live in this area, I told her to text me today/tomorrow and I’ll try to catch it if it’s down. I explained how difficult it would be, since it flies. Otherwise I told her to call RARE and leave a message.
