- Dusted dust that has been there since the beginning of time.
- The printer at the clinic is out of ink, I will look at it on Friday and get a toner.
- If anyone is wanting\needing PPE - Gowns, masks, and foot covers, I believe they are on the lower shelf of the end table when you first walk in.  I will confirm Friday.
