# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Cedar Rapids Conservation from last night about a BAEA. Message said they called Wild Thunder, too. I returned message, but haven’t heard back from them. 
- Scott County Humane Society 563-388-6655 COHA HBC, Has open compound fracture and shoulder dislocation to the right wing. She said they have the means to humanely euthanize onsite and is reaching out to DNR to see what is legally allowable, but wanted to touch base with us. Told her we can still assess and do exam, but she has opted to call DNR first and will let me know if we can assist further..
