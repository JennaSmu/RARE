# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- On 6/15 we received a call about a possum that was then picked up by animal control. Guy called back and to see how it was doing. I told him that since it did not come into our care, we do not know. Referred him to Iowa City Animal Control.
- Two calls about baby birds falling out of their nest. One in Iowa City and another in Linn Co. Both referred to Dr. Jana. got in touch with one and left a voicemail to the other.
