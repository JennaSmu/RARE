# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::Jay]
- 5:27 pm - 319-359-0807 Alana - Baby rabbits. Called back and since the voicemail was full sent a text. Waiting to receive information as to where they are so I can properly refer them.
- 9:20 pm - Mic Preston IA RTHA in backyard. Injured. Can't put in box. 563-206-4827. Called back. Seems like a juvenile RTHA who is hanging out on the farm. Assured them that they can observe for now.
- Goose caught in netting in Scott County. Referred. Noticed we don’t have Scott County in the IA DNR Rehab list. The caller gave the contact info of who they got in touch with: Brooks VanDerBeek (563-349-8953). Should we add him to the contact list?
- Injured chipmunk in Scott County. Referred.
- 319-750-4702 Coralville, IA. Injured finch. Referred to Dr. Jana.
- 515-480-1946 Tom. Iowa city. Baby cardinal on street. Couldn't find nest. Box for the night. Referred to Dr. Jana.
- Injured robin in Bettendorf. Referred. 
- Crazy lady from North Liberty. Called about a vulture, we think a TUVU. The bird was flying around and shaking its head. It seems like it was preening and getting gnats off of it. However, the caller was sure it had rabies and was going to come for her kids and pets. Though we told her that vultures can’t get rabies since they digest it and only eat dead things, the caller threatened to shoot the bird. Sonja went out and checked out the address to protect the bird from this caller. But, she could not find it. 
- Displaced songbirds in Red Oak, IA. Referred to Iowa Bid Rehab in Des Moines.
