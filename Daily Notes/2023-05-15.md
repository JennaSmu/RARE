# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Dawn, Sonja]
- If you’re by yourself and need to give a bird fluids, you can put a smaller amount (less than half) than the amount we would give subcutaneously (under the skin with a needle) into the bird’s mouth or into food or pieces of food being handfed.  You can use the same fluids or Pedialyte / Gatorade.
- Treatment bird cages should have at least 2 layers of newspaper covering all of the floor of the cage.  You can use half sized pieces, but please put them on the bottom underneath the full size sheets, if you can.
- All the newspaper from Killy & Bano’s cage doesn’t need to be thrown away every day.  Sometimes, I just take off the pieces on top that are dirty and add more clean ones on top of the ones that were already there.

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Molly from Burlington found a sparrow nestling that fell out of a nest on her porch. I told her to put it in a new nest as close to the original as possible in the morning. He died, but she will try to protect the others from her neighbor’s cats when they fledge.
