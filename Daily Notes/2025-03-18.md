>>##### 🗨️Comments:
>> - [ ] #🦅🩺-bird-care/short-term If this bird doesn’t eat the bluegill today, we should make sure to HF for a few more days at least. In her thin state, I’d hate to see her miss 1+ more days of food.

>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - She was standing when we arrived, holding L wing out a bit away from her body.
>> - Colin or Kathy: I was thinking… maybe the extended left wing is to help her with balance? She fell in cage when we put her back in.
>> - She should easily HF in cage. If you hold the food in front of her face she will bite at it.
