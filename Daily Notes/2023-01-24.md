# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Call - from CR.  Lady called and said she had 3 finches she wanted to surrender because she was traveling soon. She tried the local pet stores and they referred her to us. I suggested talking to the animal shelters in the area to see if they knew of anyone who took unwanted birds. Does anyone know who might take them or is interested in adopting them? I told her we’d call her back if we had any more suggestions. Her number is 312-837-6323. I left her message on the answering machine. (from Dawn: I let her know about a local FB pet bird group she can post in or email the Iowa Parrot Rescue.)
