# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Sonja]
- Pulled Quail for tomorrow and all of the mice that I pulled from the cages today.  We can feed extra again, due to the cold. 
- Please place any left over frozen food back in the freezer.
- Did not clean, rake or fill water.
- Lots of snow in the corncrib.
- The lock on the corn crib was frozen, I had to work with each of the numbers to get them to turn.
