# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Iowa City, baby rabbit, advised to return to nest, if not possible referred to Dr Jana. 
- Iowa City, mallard nest in daycare playground, daycare provider moved eggs, we advised to contact IC animal control and allow them to decide what to do. In hindsight, DNR would have been a better choice. Note we did tell provider correct decision would have been to fence area and leave nest undisturbed. Provider said that wasn’t possible. (Eggs should not have been moved via Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.)
- Iowa City, Canada goose, caller was at Hancher, concerned about goose that she thought might be tangled in fishing line.  Goose was hobbling and trying to groom legs.  Advised her to contact IC animal control.
