> [!info]-
> Misc - Kathy: Are the rehabbers taking waterfowl given avian flu is still a concern? I would not want to give callers “false hope” and also do not want to set up the rehabbers to be “chewed out” for saying “no” to a caller. Advise when you can Thanks.

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Two calls on injured geese. One call on window strike cardinal. Referred to rehabbers.
- One call from woman who said “an eagle hit her windshield” near Wilson Orchard (off of Hwy 1 going to Solon). She has already called Iowa City Animal Center. They responded. Eagle flew off, contacted ICAC to say thank you and that RARE was here to help as needed,
