# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Donna called about a bird (raptor) that hit her window.  I called her back but it went to VM and she never returned my call.
- Rose from Riverside called regarding an eagle that was on the East bank of the Iowa River.  She lived on the West Bank.  I googled the address to see what was on the East bank… Farm field, no through road.  I called the DNR and Washington County Conservation.  Washington County went out, put eyes on the bird.  He was walking around, doing some hop flying, but never getting airborne.  The ice wasn’t safe and Zack (WCC) indicated that there were potentially several property owners that they would need to track down in order to get permission to go in..  
- Caller from Bettendorf called about a Coyote with mange that was outside her business.  Referred to DNR or Scott County Conservation.
