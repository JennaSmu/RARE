# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- What was the note on the table about John Freiereisen Cedar Rapids for?  Does someone need to call him? I took a photo of the #, so I can call him if need be.  Filled alcohol containers.  Didn’t have time to figure out how to dilute the Rescue to fill the spray bottles and couldn’t find the unconcentrated bottle (maybe we used it all).
- Karen Tobin had a songbird in Fairfield with an injured wing - referred her to Dr. Jana. 
- Hope Plans, home: (563) 374-1650, cell: (563) 579-7176, had a RTHA with a wing dragging in Wheatland.  Jessica went to catch it tonight but the finder couldn’t locate it.  Jessica is available tomorrow after 7 am if Hope can find it again.
