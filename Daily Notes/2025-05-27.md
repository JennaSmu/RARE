# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Iowa City, 560th Street, off Sand Road, Finder thought they came across an injured hawk in the ditch with another hawk circling overhead. Jeanine checked out and couldn’t locate the bird but did see a hawk flying in the area. Sounds like it could have been a fledgling and parent. Finder didn’t get a pic.
- Davenport, injured crow. Gave them Dr. Jana info for them to text her pic and info.
- Bettendorf, injured mourning dove or pigeon. Gave them Dr. Janas info for them to text her pic and info.
- Iowa City, another call on the BDOW baby at Performing Arts building. Was placed in tree this morning where it stayed most of the day but it’s on the ground again.
- Bertram, hawk on ground most of day, doesn’t fly when approached. Sent pic which I shared with Sonja. Fledgling, looks healthy.
