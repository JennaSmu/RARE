>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - Loose in the clinic.  We had the garage door open today for a couple of hours and no go. 
>> - Amanda, Halie, Luke and I all tried to catch, she would act tired and then just fly around some more. 
>> - She will come down when she gets hungry. 
>> - I did pull a quail, I wanted to tie a string around the leg and pull on the floor to entice her down, and then hopefully net her. 
>> - Her R wing is droopy, but she flies great.
