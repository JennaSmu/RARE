# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Jodeane, Kathy]
- Music was way too loud music most of time we were there, it sounded like it was coming from both the wall north of us and the wall east of us at different times.  Sometimes it was louder than others.  Gym owner called. Problematic conversation. Also spoke with the owner of the complex. Basically he has a long lease with them and we have to live with it or move. The owners of 29A will be in town this weekend and I will have a conversation with them. Please do not go over and talk with them. Remember we can park downspout to downspout in front of bldg. Please park in the spot closest to them, Use the downspout as a guide not the lines. It is the only way we can keep our three spots at this point. Thanks all.
