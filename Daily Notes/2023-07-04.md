>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - [Killy](../RARE%20Birds/Ed%20Birds/Killy.md) didn’t want to come out at first, then stayed in the window for 6 hrs.  Didn’t feed babies at all while we were there but screeched a lot.
>> - [2353 AMKE](../RARE%20Birds/2353%20AMKE.md) + [2354 AMKE](../RARE%20Birds/2354%20AMKE.md): Female is up to 150g & male up to 110g. 
>> - The green turf is too hard to clean, so I just put a towel on the bottom of Killy’s cage.

>> [!notice]
>> ##### 🗨️Comments:
>> - If she eats the 2 m in her cage on her own tomorrow when you arrive, I don’t think we need to HF anymore. 
>> - We put her back in the double cage, so you can clean using the divider and not handle her at all.

>> [!Medical]+
>> ##### 💊 Meds:
>> - Gave 35 mL Norm SQ in L & R ing.
>> - Metronidazole for a fungal infection. 
>> 	- I used the 25 mg per kg dose because he was young. He needed 9 g. I cut a ¼ tablet (250 mg) into 7 pieces.
>>
>> ##### 🩺Caregiving:
>> - Weighed: 14 + 1/8 oz
>> - His vent had some dirt caked on, so we washed him in the sink then dried him with a towel and the hairdryer on warm/low. 
>> - He had a lot of cream colored semi mushy blobs of something in his mouth.  I removed them easily by wiping with a q-tip.
>>
>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - Threw up and pooped on Susan
>>
>>##### 🥼 Rule/Out:
>>- Fungal infection
>>
>> ##### 🗨️ Treatment Comments:
>> - Fungal infections can be contagious, so I put him in a quarantine cage by the washer, washed all towels, disinfected gloves, & emptied garbage.  Please treat him last.
