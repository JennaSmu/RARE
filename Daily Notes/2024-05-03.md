# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Dawn, Nettie]

- Found ants underneath one of the newspaper totes, swept up residue, put alcohol on floor, and moved tote to the side.
- Music was loud.

>>##### 🫧 Clean:
>> - We couldn’t find a clean black mat to put in his cage, so we used a towel.
>>
>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - Had taken a bath and was soaking wet when I came in. 
>> - Put him in the windowsill with the window slightly open for him to get some Vitamin D but closed it later because I wasn’t sure if he was cold. 
>> - He had a dark spot on his R foot, one of the front toes on the ends. 
>> 	- I tried to wash it off to see if it was poop or food or an injury, but it would not come off at all, so I’m still not sure. 
>> - He bumped a blood feather.

>> - Started eating right away.
>> - Her clicking sounded slightly raspy.
