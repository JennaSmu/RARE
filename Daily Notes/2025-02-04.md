# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Cedar Rapids, Rockwell Collins, 2 calls on an adult RTHA that was sitting on top of a bike rack by an entrance that wasn’t moving. They thought it was injured and called the DNR. DNR told them it was probably bird flu and if they wanted they could call us. I talked her into approaching it to see if it could fly. It flew off fine and landed on a nearby rooftop.
- Cedar Rapids, caller had hit a BDOW last night, deceased. He wanted to know if he needed to get it to us or how to dispose of it. He told me he appreciated the work we do and is sending us a check donation.
- Rural Iowa City, caller was observing several BAEAs feasting on an animal in a field. He thought a juvenile couldn’t fly. When I returned the call he told me that he had seen it fly off.
