# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Colin]
- There was some event/meeting happening, and cars were showing up after I arrived.  I did not do any cleaning today, as I wanted to get out of there ASAP to make sure my car didn’t get blocked in and I would be able to leave without disturbing whatever was happening.

>> - Finished up 3rd mouse before I left the barn. 
>> - Flight seems to be slightly improved from last time I saw him, but he still has a LONG way to go. 
>> - I spread his mice out and put one of his mice up on the fat log in the corner nearest to the horse field; maybe this will encourage some more flight.
