# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Oskaloosa, Finder has observed a crow the last few days that's been walking on the ground. Concerned it might be injured. I told her how to capture if injured, etc., Dr. Jana. She wasn’t open to any of that.
- Atkins, baby bunnies that dog had destroyed the nest in his backyard. Advised to put back the survivors, how to protect the nest and keep his dog away until they’re gone.
