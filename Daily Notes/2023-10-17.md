# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Dawn, Susan]
- Please make sure everyone is putting down at least 2 layers of newspaper on all of the bottom of the clean cages.  You can use colored newspaper, just not the shiny, slippery ads.  You can use half sheets, but please put them on the bottom and cover small pieces with a full sheet on top.  2 half sheets and 2 full sheets are enough.
- The music and bass beats were very loud at 11:15 am, and there was a young adult white man outside of the gym that saw us go into the clinic.  I assume he was a customer.  It got quieter around maybe 12:15 pm and stayed at that same volume till about 2:30 pm.  If they could turn the bass down lower than the rest of the music, it would have been a fairly acceptable level, but they probably can’t.  I worry about the birds, especially Killy, if he is hearing that bass all day and all night.
- Susan Jaecques bought a bag of cardinal bird seed and left the money on the board with the Oct. schedule on it.  I hope that’s ok.  She also took home the low half log perch with black carpet to make it less wobbly.
- Sonja said for me to place the supply order tomorrow on the phone.  I could only find 1 tube of Puralube, but it’s out of stock.

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Ron Tjaden, (319) 480-0260, a farmer in Prairieburg (Linn Co), has seen a hawk or immature eagle earlier today and 2 days ago on his property running fast but not flying.  I said it sounded like it needs help.  He will try to catch it if it comes back.  He said there is an eagle nest down the road from him.
- A woman called yesterday to report an injured crow on Bowery St.  I left her a voicemail saying she could catch it and call Dr. Jana directly.
