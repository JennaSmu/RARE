# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Dawn, Alicia]
- The small scale batteries need replaced, and we didn’t have time in the evening to look to see if we had any new ones in the clinic.  I left it on the tool box.  (I used the eagle scale for 2434, but then when I was going to look for batteries this morning, it worked again, so I thought it was working again.)

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Dog hurt rabbit in IC - referred to Suzanne or Dr. Jana. 
- Nestling baby bird on ground Cedar Rapids - she couldn’t get on a ladder or drive and didn’t want to touch the bird or ask her roommate for help, I was coaching her through re-nesting, but it died before she got it back outside (she did call Wildthunder to pick up the bird, but Tracy couldn’t.)
- Scott Hawks in Mount Pleasant hit a Mourning Dove with his car but didn’t have time to stop on his way to work.  When he got home, it was in the grill of his car.  Referred to Dr. Jana.
