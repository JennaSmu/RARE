>>##### 🫧 Clean:
>> - [🧼🏠](../Admin/Codes/Moved%20to%20clean%20cage.md)
>>
>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - Eye does not look deflated or cloudy.
>> - Gave 0.392 cc Metacam in mouth but the weight of the bird was recorded wrong initially. The weight is 0.963 KG so the dose of Metacam going forward should be 1.284 cc.
>> - When we removed the towels from his old cage there was no poop at all. 
>> - Was standing a bit when placed in new cage.
