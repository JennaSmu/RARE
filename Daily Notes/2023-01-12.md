# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Dania]
- All birds doing well. Removed ice from water and raked cages.
- Asio silently judged me while I raked.
- [Denali](../RARE%20Birds/Ed%20Birds/Denali.md) flying well.
- [22117 RTHA](../RARE%20Birds/22117%20RTHA.md) flew around a little while I was raking her cage. I left each of her mice on a different perch to encourage use of her wings. 

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Call about a deer with a broken leg. Called back and left a message to contact either the DNR or their county conservation office. Left Johnson County Conservation's number in case they lived in the county.
