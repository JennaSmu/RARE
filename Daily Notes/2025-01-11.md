# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- (Fri night) Bleeding goose in North Liberty - referred to Dr. Jana. 
- Caller reported hawk in Davenport but had asked Scott Co Animal Protection to pick it up before I called her back.  She went back after and checked but bird was gone. I called Animal Protection to inquire if they had the bird, & they sent me a video that showed it flying off.
