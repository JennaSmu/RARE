# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Louisa County, baby bunny.
- Iowa City, Riverside Drive by Performing Arts building, fledgling BDOW, sent pic, looked fine at base of tree.  She later called me back and said someone from Iowa Raptor set it up on a  branch in tree, not sure who that was.
- Rural Wilton, (563-357-1131 Rob Jipp), intersection of Spicer Avenue and 325th Street (gravel roads). There is an injured adult BAEA in cornfield.  Eagle has been captured. I’m meeting him tomorrow at 9 in West Branch to transport to clinic.  Sonja–can you please assist/instruct tomorrow’s crew with admit?
