# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Report of an injured BAEA on the side of the road between Tiffin and Coralville by US Foods. Caller had noticed for the last 2 days. Z was able to drive by and investigate. Z said from the road it looked like an eagle so she got out of her truck to get a closer look. What she found was a bag of garbage! I called the person back that reported it to tell her what we found and thanked her for reaching out.
