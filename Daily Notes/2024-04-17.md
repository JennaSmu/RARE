# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Lia, Jodeane, M]
- Colin: Does anyone know anything about the wire cage that was brought in sitting across from Killy’s cage? Is it meant to be returned to someone? The cage Bano was in? I believe it was donated to us.
	- Kathy: If it’s a puppy playpen, that’s mine. Lent to Sonja’s rescued domesticate rabbit. I’ll get it tomorrow. There will always be more puppies at our place.

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Someone called about some baby geese they think were abandoned - we asked them to wait and call back later today if the parents haven’t returned.
- Call from someone who came upon a deceased owl while walking their dog in their neighborhood and asked if they needed to report or do anything. Advised them on how to dispose of carcass naturally or with trash bag.
- Call from someone who discovered what they think is a woodpecker. Alert, but can’t move. Advised no food or water, safe box. Referred to Dr Jana.
