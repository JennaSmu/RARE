# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Dawn, Andie]
- Filled anesthesia machine with isoflurane, and that bottle was getting low.  Didn’t check to see if we had another bottle.  Opened the last anesthesia charcoal filter and wrote it down on list of medical things to order.

>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - Got window time. 
>> - He was sitting fluffed out in the bottom corner of his cage (which can be a sign of illness), but he acted normal after that. 
>> - Tiny drop of blood on wing. 
>> - He put himself away then hopped out of his cage again, so we put him back a second time before we left.
