>> ##### 🗨️Comments:
>> - Use extreme caution when entering cage and be ready to dodge him!
>> - [ ]  #🦅🩺-bird-care/short-term He was repeatedly flying into the wooden slats facing the horse field/banos cage, so I closed the sliding door on the outside of the barn to ensure he doesn’t keep thinking it’s a way out. Please do not re-open the door until this specific bird is no longer in those cages.
