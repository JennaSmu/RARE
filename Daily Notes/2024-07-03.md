# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Don called from Blairs ferry road, working at a house and observed a large bird on the ground, larger bird flying around it. Asked if he could get a picture and text to Flora or capture the bird and move it to a tree branch. Possibly a raptor fledge that’s being fed by the parent. Didn’t get a text back from back from Don. 319-361-7596
- Amanda- Jodeane called me about a gentleman with a down ghow, he's bringing it from Burlington to me, and I'll transport it to clinic early Friday morning.
