# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Call about a hawk in a window well in Davenport unable to get out.  Called back and someone from Hog Capital Wildlife Rehab picked up.
- Cardinal in the Davenport unable to fly.  Advised to put in a box with holes, in a warm area away from noise and pets etc…  Check on it after an hour or so, could be stunned from a window strick.  Gave Dr Jana’s number if it didn’t get better.
