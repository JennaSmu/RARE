# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Colin, Ella]
- Hooked up my laptop at clinic. Much faster/easier to use! It is signed in to a google account I made for rare with access to the notes. No need to log in/out of your personal google account to do notes while at clinic. PIN for the computer is 2315.
- To access notes on the clinic computer:
	- Open Microsoft Edge
	- Click “Clinic Notes” on the “favorites” bar
	- Enter notes like normal
