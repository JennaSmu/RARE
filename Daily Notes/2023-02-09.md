# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::Dania, Amanda]
- Eagle under a bridge eating fish, possible wing injury, called back and finder said it had flown away.
- Injured bat in Illinois close to Clinton border, called back and referred to Echo Guard in DeWitt. I wasn't sure if the finder could transport bats across state lines to Iowa but said Echo may know more about it.
- Owl in a chimney in Des Moines, finder had reached out to multiple places including IBR (I was ready to refer him to them) but had yet to hear back. Owl was in reach to grab a few times but kept climbing out of reach. He was more than willing to grab the owl and had everything ready for when he could finally get it. He didn't think it was injured but had the number of rehabbers in case it was.
