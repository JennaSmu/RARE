# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- SO many calls today, Baby birds, Bunnies etc. Thanks to those that helped out, I appreciate it. I had two complaints from different people  about wildThunder, rudeness, and threatening law enforcement on them. PLEASE do not refer people to WildThunder.They are overflowing and seem unable to offer help. There are others better suited to help.**
