# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Dawn, Susan]
- We shipped 4 BAEA’s by Fedex at Mailboxes Etc (the UPS store by Leash on Life doesn’t accept Fedex) in IC to the National Eagle Repository and marked their case #’s in the log books (for 2022 & 2023) with the shipping date.  They have more forms to fill out now and want to know extensive information on each bird.  There are 3 more to go, hopefully Mon.  Luke asked me to add the BAEA feathers in the education box with other wings and feet to the shipment to NER, but I forgot, so I will add them to the box on Mon. What other wings and feet from ed. Box are you talking about?  Luke said there were BAEA feathers that someone collected in that box that he wanted me to send to NER. Ok just wanted to be sure you were not sending our ed. Stuff. THANKS

>> - I was concerned that they lost 2 g each in 2 days (and their crops were not full.
>> - I left the door open, and the female flew out up on a ledge on the wall by the garage door. I tried to get her to fly more and tire her out while Susan used the gentle approach, and she stepped up onto the net.

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Connie had baby birds in a wheel well of a truck, renested.  
- Mike from Fairfield called back.  He took a nestling robin from his neighbor in an HOA that was a half mile away.  He said he fed it for 4 days and nursed it back to health but now wanted to bring it to someone in IC.  He said it was hopping at this point and not injured, so I told him that it needed to be reunited with its parents or placed with a foster family of robins with offspring the same age.  He said he’s had problems dealing with the HOA before, so I said he could ask Dr. Jana if she wanted to take it or call his county conservation for help finding a foster.
- Cooper’s seen flapping both wings but not flying w/other birds that look like him, left alone.
- Raccoon in Iowa City. 
- Sandy Gray called for an update on the hawk taken to IRP yesterday, informed her that it ended up at Wildthunder.
