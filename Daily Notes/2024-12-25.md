# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Dawn, Flora]

> [!info]-
> - [ ] #⚠️-attention IBR & Blackhawk aren’t taking waterfowl because of avian flu, so we need to be watching for signs of it (rapidly dilating pupils and seizures/shaking/tremors) in our intakes as well.
> - [ ] #⚠️-attention 1 bag of fluids with tape on it has a hole and is leaking.  I think we have to throw it away because it’s not sterile anymore.

>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - I would like to give him another platform for him to jump down onto below the table underneath the window before he gets to the floor. 
>> - Also, maybe the jesses he has now are causing him to trip, but I didn’t want him to open any blood feathers
>> - We let him out on a perch on the ground but not the window. 
>> - He was out a long time and put himself away later on.

>>##### 💊 Meds:
>> - [Metacam](../Admin/Codes/Medication/Metacam.md) high dose (1.4 not 1.5 mL) 3 days + any day wound is cleaned)
>> - [Clavamox](../Admin/Codes/Medication/Clavamox.md) low dose for 7 days,
>> - Last day of [💉Fluids](../Admin/Codes/Medication/Fluids.md) tomorrow (upped dose according to 10% dehydration formula).

>>
>>##### 🩺Caregiving:
>> - Double checked exam and medicine dosages, packed pill case
>> - Cleaned, applied Vetasan, & bandaged R leg just above foot and R wrist.   
>> - I don’t think the wrist bandage needs changed tomorrow unless it comes off (or you smell necrosis or see maggots in wound). 
>> - You can do a canvas or Fig. 8 wrap to keep it on. 
>> - [ ] #🦅🩺-bird-care Please HF him enough to get the meds down.
>>
>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - Keel score 4.5, so I don’t think he needs 3 m a day while getting fluids
