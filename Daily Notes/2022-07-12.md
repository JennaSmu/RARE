>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - I worked with her by supporting her torso, held around her body below wings placing her feet on astroturf perch and lightly supporting her.  She was grasping pretty well with her feet but still quite unsteady.  She was definitely getting the idea though and would hold pretty well before losing her balance.  Jodeane suggested no more towels and to work with her every day like this with either low perches or the astroturf ones
