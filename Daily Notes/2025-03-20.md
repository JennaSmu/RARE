> - [ ] #⚠️-attention The syringes were still wet, so I was only able to sack up one batch.
> - [ ] #⚠️-attention I moved a few things off of the black shelves (syringes, needles, clipboard and tegaderm).  These are now in the rolling medical shelves by the exam table.  Please let me know if you are unable to find something.  I have also located some separators for the smaller syringes.
> - [ ] #⚠️-attention I have food, mice, for the barn.  I did not make it out there today, but will get them out this weekend.  Please sub small rats if we run out of mice.
