- Steve Shillman (319) 330-4450, had a “friend?” crow that fell on ground this spring and he had been feeding it.  He said it disappeared the other day and was wondering if someone brought it to us.  I’m confused because the last crows we had were AMCR - 22101 was euthanized on 10/3/22 due to neurological issues, & AMCR - 2298 was euthanized on 9/28/22 for a right wing fx.  I did not contact him because I wasn’t sure if there was another crow that came in since then, or if he did not get notified or wasn’t listed as a finder on the paperwork.
- Alisha Latart (978) 826-0220, called to report a very large bird (maybe a hawk) sitting on the ground in the front yard of a brown house with a red door on the corner of S Iowa & E Short St in Solon at 2 pm.  She went back by it at 3 and said it was gone.
