>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - Flew HP-HP twice when I first got there, but after that, got pretty sloppy. She ran into the wall a couple of times, landed on the ground once, hung from the ceiling, but always landed upright, perched well, and continued to try to fly.  Going to need some work and strength before she’s ready to go.

>> - I wasn’t expecting that [River](../RARE%20Birds/Ed%20Birds/River.md) and [Denali](../RARE%20Birds/Ed%20Birds/Denali.md) to be in the back area together, but they seem to be ok with each other. I hope the cages were supposed to be open between them.

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- From Marion, injured duck in yard.  Returned call and referred to Wildthunder.
- Shawn from North Liberty 319-600-2324. He called about a cowbird egg that was laid in a finch nest with 6 eggs and wanted to know if we wanted it.  He also asked about BAEA 2319 (DOT). He lives in North Liberty and monitors the nest off Forevergreen Rd. He knows 2319’s story and gave me an exact location of its nest where he says its mate is. I’m assuming he heard or witnessed her getting hit and then noticed it missing from the nest. He gave me the exact location in case we don’t have it.  I also left a copy of this info at clinic so we can put it with her chart. Please call him when/if she is released so he can be there if possible.
	- [2319 BAEA](../RARE%20Birds/2319%20BAEA.md) nest location - From Coralville heading north on 965 towards North Liberty, turn left on Forevergreen Road, turn left on Covered Bridge Boulevard, go 1 block to Red Barn Drive then look west and you can see the nest in an evergreen tree.
