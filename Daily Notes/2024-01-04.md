# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::Ella]
- There was a saved message about an BAEA that we didn’t know about. Did anyone follow up on that? The call from Wednesday came in at 6:20 pm, the eagle wasn’t contained, it was just seen around a farm hop flying.   Sonja called the caller, Christina, Thursday evening.  The eagle could not be located Thursday morning.
