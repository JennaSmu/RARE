# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
 - Dubuque County Conservation, Adult BAEA with injured leg. Called back and they had also called Wildthunder. They were waiting to hear back from Tracy and going to take there since closer. I asked her to call me back with an update and told her that we’d take it if Wildthunder couldn’t. Haven’t heard back.
 - Bettendorf - Caller had found a baby coon 4 months ago on his rental property. He kept it and now no longer wants it and wants to relocate. I gave him the name of some raccoon rehabbers in his area to call for advice/help.
 - Cedar Rapids - Injured songbird from woman’s outside cat. Referred.
 - Iowa City - Caller had AMCR in yard that appeared injured.  Referred.
