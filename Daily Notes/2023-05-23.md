# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- From late last night. Michelle from Oskaloosa about baby owls in the park on the ground. Could these be the same 2 that we received a call about on Saturday from a different guy?  She put them at the base of a tree but was concerned when they were still there later when she checked back.  I told her to keep an eye on them from a distance and to call back if they appear unwell or injured.
- Caller has injured vulture in SW Iowa, referred to SOAR.  
- Caller had baby bird found in garage, referred to Dr. Jana
