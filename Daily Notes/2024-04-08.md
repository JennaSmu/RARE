# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Baby GHOW on the ground that caller was on way to pick up when she left VM. I called her back, she did not answer, so I left her a voicemail telling her if it's not injured to leave it alone or put in makeshift nest. Did not hear back from her.
- Large eggs (bigger than chicken) found under porch. Caller said she has not seen any ducks/geese in the area. I told her to observe for a few days to be sure she's not disturbing an active nest, but that it may just be a stockpile that a raccoon or similar animal has stored there after raiding a nest.
