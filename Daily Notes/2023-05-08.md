# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Sonja, Dawn]
- At this point the chest freezer that we put the food to pull for the day is unplugged.  It was making noises and the food inside wasn’t frozen, luckily it was still cold. I defrosted and I will vacuum out the coils.
- The chest freezer that we put birds in is very full. We have requested eagle labels and they said it could be 6-8 weeks.
