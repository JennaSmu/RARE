# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Received call from Kim working at clinic about a BAOW not flying sitting on a stump. I had time to pick it up on my wall to do chores at the barn.  Picked up  juv. BAOW from Meadow Lane, east of Highway 965 on the southside of the Coralville Res. Did not appear to have any broken bones, but the right eye appears foggy. Delivered to Kim at clinic after completing chores at barn.
