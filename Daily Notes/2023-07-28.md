# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Sonja, Kathy]
- Medication order has been checked in.  I have all of the extra’s in a box on the counter by the small refrigerator.  Please leave it there for now.  
- The AC unit is dripping, there is a bucket underneath the unit and all of the furniture has been moved to prevent damage.  I have a call into the AC contractor, but since its still cooling I think it’s fine.  It wasn’t leaking on Monday after they left, I hope its just due to the high temps.  I will follow up with them tomorrow.
- There are styrofoam boxes that food comes in.  I have the address (839 S 1st Ave, IC: Sellers & Seekers Real Estate) on the boxes of a company that will accept them to use for feral cat homes.  If anyone has time could they please drop off.  This building has an entryway that can be opened, and the boxes can be left in there even if no one is there. Please and thanks  (from Denise–I can take the styrofoam boxes to Shelly)**

# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Nancy]
- Be careful to move wood blocks that secure cage doors so they can’t fall back in place and trap you in back cages.  I was careless about that today and got locked in. I was lucky that my husband came along today and was waiting in the car.  I managed to get his attention, but the Ransom cage was secured shut from the inside. He was able to lift the hook and walk through to let me out of the back cage. It would have been an unpleasantly hot wait in the cage to get someone else’s attention if it had come to that!
