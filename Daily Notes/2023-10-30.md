# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- One call about a CAGO in north liberty. He said he thinks it was hit by a car, but it doesn't have any apparent injuries, just extremely lethargic. I referred to Dr Jana and/or blackhawk, and informed him not to touch it until he speaks with them, as waterfowl are HPAI vector species.
