# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- A couple calls on HY RTHA. advised one to leave it be, and I will go check on the other one when I get back to QC. Update: bird was ok. I left it alone.
- Call about “abandoned bird” at a library (caller didn't say where). When I called back, they hung up on me.
- Call from Benton County Conservation about injured RTHA. Sonja met up with them, and it was just a HY. BCC will return it to where it was found.
