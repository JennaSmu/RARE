# 🏡Barn:

- All birds doing well.  Yesterday, Jumbo Rats were pulled for all birds (except [Asio](../RARE%20Birds/Ed%20Birds/Asio.md)).  Please make sure only to pull jumbo rats for eagles and turkey vultures.  If there is no other suitable food, pull 1 jumbo rat per 2 birds and they can be cut in half before feeding.
