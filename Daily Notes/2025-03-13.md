# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Cy’s Tree Service -  Tree was cut down with 2 young GHOW’s (still have egg teeth) in the nest in Ely.  Went out to collect the babies and check out the tree location for a renest.  No large trees in the area, have a call into the Ely Fire Department if they can help with the renest. Did not see parents in the area when we were there, but they were there earlier in the day.  Babies are with Sonja.
