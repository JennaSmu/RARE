# 🏡Barn:

- [volunteers::Sonja]
- [River](../RARE%20Birds/Ed%20Birds/River.md) went home with me.
- [21138 RTHA](../RARE%20Birds/21138%20RTHA.md) - doing fine in the barn. No leftovers.
- [Denali](../RARE%20Birds/Ed%20Birds/Denali.md) - doing fine in the barn.  No leftovers.
- Raked cages and office area.  Scrubbed out all water bowls, added new water, picked up a ton of feathers in the RTHA and Rivers cage. Changed out the zapper and scrubbed out the food bucket.

# 📞Calls:

- [volunteers::]
- One from Fort Madison concerning a bat, referred to Ft Madison wildlife rehabber listed on DNR.
- One call from IC concerning a possum; the possum seemed unlikely to make it, but still referred caller to Dr. Jana.
- One call from IC about a juvenile eagle; the caller was able to speak to the farm owner where the eagle had been born, and determined that everything was fine.
