# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- 1 call about a crow in cedar rapids with a hurt foot.  Gave number to Dr. Jana and wildthunder.
- Received an email from a photographer about a BAEA with a missing beak in cedar rapids.  Was flying in the photo he sent me.  Informed we cannot catch a bird that is able to fly, but to keep his eye out and if he sees it deteriorating or in a position to be caught to contact us.  Also provided instructions for capture if he feels comfortable enough if/when it is in a state where it can be captured.
