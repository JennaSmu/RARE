# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Brad]
- All birds fed and watered. Spent more time today raking cages and scraping some areas of accumulated waste. Especially in the BDOW cage. Pellet jars knocked off shelf behind freezer. I suspect a raccoon as I also removed raccoon waste near steps. I removed trash. 
- All other birds ate all food from Saturday.
