# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Calls about moving nests and songbirds.  Advised that it was illegal to move a nest.  Then they told me they had already moved it.  Told them at that point, to make sure it was as close to the original nest as they could get.  
- Injured cardinal in IC - referred to Dr Jana.
- 2 instances of babies falling out of the nest, advised if not injured to place back in nest.
- 4 calls about baby racoons.  Referred to Gayla, Blackhawk, Gateway wildlife rescue and Dr Jana.  I think everyone is full up with baby coons.  🙁
