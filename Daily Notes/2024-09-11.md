# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Finder of COHA 24109 returned call from Amanda. I informed her that the COHA had passed away. 
- Bellvue, (563-495-8894) finder has an injured owl in yard that appears to have a broken wing. He was not willing to attempt capture. I gave him phone numbers of 2 county conservation officers. He didn’t call back with any update. If anyone knows of help closer to location please reach out.
- Davenport, injured goose in Vandevere Park with fishing line and hook on legs. Colin advised me that rehabbers in QCA are aware of this bird. Closest rehabbers are either Dr. Jana or Tracy at Wildthunder. Many have reported and attempted to help it. I gave her this info, county conservation numbers and IBR info.
