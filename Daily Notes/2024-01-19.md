# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Sonja, Sarah]
- Music was louder than it has been in a while.
- The clinic door did NOT want to lock.  The lock would just spin instead of engaging the deadbolt. I used the hair dryer to thaw out the lock and the lock started to engage the deadbolt.

# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Amanda]
- The snow towards corn crib and bano’s enclosure is really deep, it was up to my knees, and I'm tall. Be really careful walking out there
- Sugar bottom road was very slick, so drive safely! The driveway for barn wasn't bad, my little car handled it pretty easily
- Email from JCC they did plow and sand at about 1 pm.
