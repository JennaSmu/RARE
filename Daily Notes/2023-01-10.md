# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- From Kalona, Alan Parsons (319-241-5409) is a construction worker at Pleasantview nursing home building their new addition.  He said there was a small owl in a room where they are working and had been locked in for 2 days.  We told him to leave a door/window open and also how to capture it and release it outside. He called back later in the afternoon and said it was still there.  Either JC or I can drive down there tomorrow and release it or bring it back to clinic if needed.
