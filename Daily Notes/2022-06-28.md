# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Finder was elderly lady that had injured goose dragging wing in yard, 2 miles north of I80.  Jeanine took this one and called both Erika and Brad (DNR) for them.
- Finder from Deep River found baby kestrel in yard. Sent me pics and determined it was too young to be a fledgling.  Sonja was able to help them determine where the nest might be located and they were able to successfully locate and renest the baby with a sibling.
