# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Colin, Elana]
- Cleaned up around clinic. Please note new cleaning chart on table. This will help us keep up with things so they don’t all always fall on one person. There will be 1 cleaning task assigned each day (but feel free to do more if you see it needs it). Please add your initials to the chart on the table to signify you have completed.

# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Colin]
- 2 wild BDOW were in the barn. The hole has been patched that let them access the smaller cages, but please keep an eye on them while at barn. The window upstairs was not open enough for them to get out, so I opened it slightly more (otherwise they would have had to fly down the stairs to get out).
