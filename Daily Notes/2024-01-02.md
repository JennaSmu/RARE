# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Sam from USDA Wildlife Services Cargill in Eddyville, he had an injured GHOW at their work place that he said was in rough shape. I called back, no answer. Left him the number of Jodi Rigler (next county over) to see if she could assist. Also gave him IBRs info as they’re a bit closer than we are.
- Coralville, Finder had a homing pigeon that had wandered on to their jobsite. It was visibly injured with a gash on its wing and chest.  He wrapped it up and kept it in his truck today and somehow found Suzanne Hoofnagles contact info after he left a message with us. Suzanne knew of a vet in CR that has experience with these birds and referred him there. Finder was taking it to the CR vet after work and she will care for and notify the bird's owner after obtaining info from its band.  He told me the band had identifying numbers and “Chicago” on it.  So interesting!  Dawn: Dr. Jana (Iowa City) will treat pigeons.  Amber Oldfield (Coggon in Linn County) did but had problems with her housing, and I don’t know if those are resolved.
