# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- From Iowa City - A UI student that is interested in volunteering with us. I left the message on the machine and her contact information on the table at the clinic. 
- From Cedar Rapids - Caller had picked up a squirrel that had gotten hit and had it in a carrier.  He said it had a nose injury. I tried calling back several times to refer and it went straight to his voice mail, was unable to leave message because his mail box is full.
