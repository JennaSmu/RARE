# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Dawn, Chris]
- I think we are on the last charcoal anesthesia filter, and it can only gain 25 more g.
- Recycling:
	- ABC Disposal picks up single stream recycling @ the clinic (which means that all the recyclable items can go in the recycling dumpster together).  Both dumpsters are red, but the one to put the recycling in is on the south side (farther away from the clinic than the garbage dumpster).  Inside the clinic, there are 2 blue bins labeled to put recyclable items into: 1 in the exam area, & 1 in the office area.  Please put clean, shiny ads from the usable newspaper into 1 of the recycling bins, & keep it separate from the containers marked as newspaper for cages.  
	- You can ask me any questions, but if you're not sure if something can be recycled or don't want to clean plastic/metal containers, just leave it in one of the blue bins, & I'll sort it and take it out.  I also put a container of scratch paper by the exam table - please keep it there, so people have paper to write down messages when we answer the phone under the exam table.  I gathered the binder clips & clothespins and moved them from the white board area to under the exam table, but I don't care where they are, so they can be moved if someone wants them somewhere else.  Thank you all so much!  
	- You can stop reading now unless you want examples of items that can and can’t be recycled:
		- YES - clean, shiny newspaper ads that we don't use in cages; other paper products like computer paper, clean paper bags, envelopes (window envelopes are ok); clean cardboard (without poop); chipboard like boxes that latex gloves come in; plastic bottles like soda, bottled water, & bleach / Dawn dish soap / eye wash containers; pill bottles; aluminum cans (like soda & clean dog food cans); & large plastic syringe containers (small pieces & caps will not be processed correctly by the single stream sorting  equipment).  Clean, soft plastic bags like grocery bags & plastic shipping air pillows and bubble wrap can't be recycled in the dumpster, but I can take it to a grocery store.
		- NO - coffee cups & lids (cardboard sleeves are ok), bags that fluids come in, paper with metallic content (like glitter), writing utensils, plastic silverware, glass, wax paper, paper containers with food on them, styrofoam, syringes, paper shipping bags with bubble wrap inside (paper can't be separated from the plastic material), & dirty plastic bags.
