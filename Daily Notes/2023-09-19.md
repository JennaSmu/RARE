# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Dawn, Susan]
- I brought a bunch of phone cords for the modem (or router?), but didn’t have a long enough one with the right shaped end, so the computer wouldn’t connect to the network.  I think it’s a male Micro USB needed.

# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Kim]
- Ed Birds all fed
- There are no more small mice that I could find at the barn, so I pulled mice for the RTHA, Denali, Asio, and Bano. I pulled small rats for River, BDOW, and the two GHOW.  Also, the food today was still partially frozen. Not sure if we can start leaving food locked under the work cabinet, but the weather is getting close.
