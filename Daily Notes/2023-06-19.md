# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Lots of calls about baby birds. 1 call about a deer. Advised or referred all to appropriate rehabbers (referred deer to DNR, as rehabbers cannot legally take in deer in Iowa).
- Call about AMKE with a broken wing in Riverside. Gave info to Dawn after speaking to finder. She will coordinate drop off for tomorrow.
