>>##### 🩺Caregiving:
>> - Unwrapped bandage: P1 + P2 still swollen, soaked foot w/ Chlorhexidine, debrided wound (wound bled a little so there’s still blood flow, was very reactive/flighty/bitey while handling wound so still has a lot of feeling in the foot, too), applied Nolvasan, re-wrapped in ball wrap.

>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - [24130 BAEA](../RARE%20Birds/24130%20BAEA.md) on ground when I came in, hopped to the other side. Hesitant to leave the corner. Hopped back and forth entire cage 3x while I was in there. Hopped up on the long branch that goes half way up the wall on the side of the cage closest to the door when I was locking up. 
>> - [24135 BAEA](../RARE%20Birds/24135%20BAEA.md) was on HPs, flew between the 2 HPs several times while I was in cage. Seemed to have difficulty balancing when landing on the HPs. Was trying to tuck wing in here and there.
