# 🏥Clinic:
- [volunteers::Dawn, Amanda]
- Picked up the MidWest Vet Supply order from Gentle Heart, confirmed that we got everything and the expiration dates were what they said on the phone, and put away.  Left the order slip on the table, there was no bill in the box.  Forgot to erase the meds on the order board if they were still there.  Couldn’t find anymore liquid Metaclopromide, do we want more on the next order?  (We still have lots of expired tablets.)
- Brought more med sheets.  The updated ones are on the bottom of the pile.
