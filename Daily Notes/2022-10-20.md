# 🏡Barn:
- [volunteers::Sonja, Luke, Brad]
- All birds fed and watered. 
- Squirrels are very active by crib; gathering hickory nuts. Robins are thick at the farm tonight too. 
- Only three large rats and quail left in freezer.  Left quail (1 ea.) and 1 medium rat for Asio for Friday feeding. Will need additional food for Saturday or need to feed out quail.
- Food was ordered but will not be delivered until next week.  I will bring out small rabbits for each of the large birds at the barn.  This will be food for them on Saturday and Sunday.
