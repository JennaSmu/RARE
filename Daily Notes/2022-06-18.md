# 🏫Education:
- [Killy](../RARE%20Birds/Ed%20Birds/Killy.md) and [Asio](../RARE%20Birds/Ed%20Birds/Asio.md) did 2 educational programs today at Lake Iowa.  Both did a great job and helped spread the word about raptors and what The RARE Group does.
- I have 2 more programs (LENA Preschool and Williamsburg Library) on Monday, I will take Killy and Asio again.  Asio will be back at the Barn on Thursday.  :)
