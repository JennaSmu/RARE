>> ##### 🗨️ Treatment Comments:
>> - Will need full exam, as I treated his wing/wounds with priority since he was losing blood, and didn’t want to stress him out too much.
>> - Please give max fluids for a couple extra days… there was a small pool of blood in the box when I picked him up, and who knows how much he lost while hanging from the fishing line before rescue, so I want to make sure he gets that replenished asap. Will asses wing on Friday and possibly take for xrays.
