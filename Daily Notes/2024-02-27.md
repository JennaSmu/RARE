# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Picked up a female bald eagle in Mechanicsville, R/O L wing FX.  Transferring to JC in the morning.  
- Cedar Rapids, Caller reported a baby owl in an open area of their roof  that had been damaged in the derecho. She sent me a pic and it was a red morph EASO sitting in the opening. She said it had been going in and out of there so I told her it probably was nesting and not to disturb.
- Coralville, Caller had 2 baby squirrels that a co-worker had found on the ground and was going to throw in a trash can. I gave her Suzanne’s number.
