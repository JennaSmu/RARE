# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Call last night about fledgling owl on ground. No injuries and was already back in tree.
- Call last night about owl HBC. Finder had wrapped in a blanket but then the owl got free and flew off.
- Hawk on ground at Norway School. When I called back, they said that they tried to capture it but then it flew away into a tree. Told them to call back if there are any changes
- Baby songbirds blew out of nest in North Liberty. Referred to Dr Jana.
- Bird flew into warehouse in IC and got stuck in glue trap. It ended up being a house sparrow, but I popped over after clinic and helped remove it with dish soap and water.
- Two calls about the same baby barred owls in Marion. The home owner called first because they had fallen out of their tree in the front yard and were getting attacked by crows. Their friend came over to put them in a box, and then called us to see if we needed to admit them. I met the friend at her house. The owlets had some gnat bites around the eyes but no other injuries. We took them back to the finder’s house, doused them with bug soother, and put them back in the original tree. While we were chatting, one of the parents flew into a neighbor’s tree to watch. Very cool!
