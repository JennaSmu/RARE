# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Carolyn & Jim Smith found a deceased juvenile BDOW on their property on Sharon Center Rd. IC (near clinic).  They thought another juvenile might be in need of help and called for advice, but the 2nd juvenile was gone by the time I called back.  Jim said he thought the deceased juv was killed by a cat because it was injured but not eaten. He has seen adults in the area, so I told them if they didn’t see obvious signs of injury, that the one that got away probably doesn’t need help.  
- Tori Meyer called about an oppossum lying on the ground on Summit St. in IC this morning.  Referred to Jennifer Barnes or Suzanne Hoofnagle.
