>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - [23116 BDOW](../RARE%20Birds/23116%20BDOW.md) flew from post to space in ceiling rafter.  I could get within a few feet and he was very hesitant.
>> - [River](../RARE%20Birds/Ed%20Birds/River.md) flew to other room, then [23116 BDOW](../RARE%20Birds/23116%20BDOW.md) followed and landed in other rafter. Noisy and a little clumsy.

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- IC - Margaret McGinnis 508-404-8586, 616 N. 1st Avenue called back, the hawk was back in her yard.  I called her back, she indicated that it was huge and that she was unable to try to catch it.  I told her I would check back with her when I was off work.
- Edie Thomas - Stuart Ct  IC - called about a COHA on her porch with an injured leg.  Called her and asked if she was able to contain it until I was able to get there after work.  She didn’t want to try to catch it because she just had surgery and didn’t want to get an infection handling the bird.  
- Denise called me and said that IC animal control had called her to update her on the COHA from yesterday and report that they had picked up an injured RTHA from the 1st ave area.  We determined that this was the same bird in the calls above.  (Margaret called back to report that the bird was gone).  Denise went to pick up - the birds R leg was barely attached.  Animal Control euthanized.
- The COHA that escaped from animal control yesterday is still in the salt barn.  An employee from the streets department called Denise, he will try to catch the hawk tomorrow.
