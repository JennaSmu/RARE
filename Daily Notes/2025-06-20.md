# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Call from last night about baby birds in CR. Based on VM, it sounded like songbirds, so left a VM with Dr Jana’s number but told them to call back if they weren’t sure or if that wasn’t the case.
- Call about nighthawk in DeWitt - kept flying down to sit in parking lot, but then flies away when approached. Not apparent injuries. Advised caller to keep an eye out for a possible nest on the ground, and if so, try to rope off so it’s not disturbed. Gave caller Dr Jana’s number in case anything changes and the bird appears to be injured.
