# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Two calls that resulted in the new admits
- Call from UI campus about a hawk with a foot injury; bird was confirmed flight capable and was in a tree sitting with one leg pulled up into its feathers. I called the finder back and left a message to see if the bird was still around (2 hours after he left the message) and I never heard back. Dawn let me know there was a Facebook post about it so hopefully someone can keep an eye on it.
