>> ##### 🔭 Observations:
>> - Sitting and standing on own.
>> - It will eat out of bowl on it’s own but eats so fast that it starts having swallow issues so we decided to HF to control how fast it ate. 
>> - When I put her back in clean cage we practiced standing on perch with me lightly supporting her torso.

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- Iowa State Patrol dispatch had report from Adam Burns in Hiawatha that there was a hawk observed sitting on a sign for an extended period of time that didn’t appear to be afraid of people. Adam went to site on Center Point Rd to take picture and send to me but couldn’t locate the hawk.
