# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::Denise, Nancy]
- Call from yesterday, downtown IC at Plaza Centre One, caller had a small bird, possible window strike, which he kept in a box overnight. I called early this morning and gave him Dr. Jana contact info.
- Two calls, both about cardinals.  First caller had found a cardinal in the road near Oxford Junction (Jones County).  Called him back shortly after he left the message, but the bird had already passed away,  Second caller, from Bluegrass (Muscatine County) had a cardinal that had struck his picture window.  Referred to Dr. Jana.
