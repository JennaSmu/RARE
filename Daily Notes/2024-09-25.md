# 🏥Clinic:

> [!info]-
> - [ ] #🛠️-maintenance Misc - washer repair guy visited, said ordered parts but we could likely use (but we can’t). We did a load that he loaded and it stuck (wouldn’t drain or spin). Sonja knows. I will try a reset washer tomorrow to get it drain. Took soaking wet towels home so they wouldn’t mold. KJ

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::]
- As of 3 PM will check again. Nighthawk down in Iowa City for several days. Refer to Dr Jana. We received messages from 2 other people.  One call was regarding frozen quail for sale at a discount which I referred to Sonja.  
- We got 3 other messages from the same person about an injured owl.  I (Connie) called her several times always getting a recording saying that the person I was calling was not taking calls.  I let Kathy know what was going on and she suggested I text her and ask her to call my number which I did.  In her final message she left her email address.  I sent her an email message and gave her my number and asked her to call me so that we could figure out a way to get the bird to the clinic.  As of now 5:48pm,  I have not heard back from her.
- 7pm - Made another attempt to call person who left messages regarding the injured owl and still getting the same recording that the person is not accepting calls
