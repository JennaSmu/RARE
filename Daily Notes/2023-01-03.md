- All birds feed and watered.  All looked well.

# 📞Calls:
- [volunteers::Denise]
- From Hamilton, IL about an injured owl. I called back to refer but they had already found a rehabber that had picked it up. 
- Call from Cedar Rapids about an injured pigeon that was found in a driveway. Referred to Dr. Jana. 
- Call from a funeral home - left a message to tell us that a donor to our organization had passed away and to remove their name from our list. I left the message on the answering machine.
