I open her cage an inch and slide the edge of a big towel inside until it’s covering the entire front of cage and pulled out a bit in the front of the cage on the left side between the cage door and the cage wall (so there’s no gap for her to fly out of the cage on that side.  I put something heavy on the top of the cage on top of the towel.  I use a welding face shield or safety glasses to cover my face in case she flies out at me.  Then, I place my gloved hand behind the towel and grab the bird.
