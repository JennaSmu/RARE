This is a reference guide for those who want to learn how to format daily notes in Obsidian or those who have learned but need a refresher.
If you do not know how or don't want to enter with formatting, go to: [[Enter Daily Notes without any formatting|Enter Daily Notes without any formatting]]

# Step 1: Make a new Daily Note:
- On the left side of the screen is the ribbon. Look over there and click the icon that looks like a calendar.
- The screenshot below shows it circled in red.

# Step 2: Click on the date
- Click on the date you have information to enter.

## If the date does not currently have a daily note:
- If the date you want to create does not have a daily note, you will get this prompt.
- Go ahead and click Create.

## If the date has a daily note:

This is what a fresh new daily note looks like.

# Step 3: Enter your information!

Use the templates! See the Hotkey section below for a refresher.

![[RARE Vault Manual#Hotkeys|RARE Vault Manual > Hotkeys]]

I usually put the daily notes in this order:
- Clinic
- Barn
- Calls

But, it doesn't really matter what order you put it in. For this guide, I'll assume you are adding information in the above order.

Now follow the steps in this note: [[Daily Notes|Daily Notes]]

# Step 4: Syncing

Now, you can leave the note up or close the current tab or close Obsidian all together.
- Either way, it doesn't matter as all changes will be synced with the other computers.

The only thing is that your current changes will not be up on the website. If you want to update the website right now, see the below steps. Otherwise, you can just leave it and someone else will update it.

## Updating the website:

### Doing it by a command:
- On the keyboard enter: Ctrl + P
	- It is Ctrl and then P.
- Search "publish"
- See the option that says: Digital Garden: Publish Single Note
	- Hit enter
- In the upper right corner, you will see a bar that says, "Publishing note…"
- When it is done, it will say, "Note successfully published."

You did it!

## Doing it by hitting the icon:
- Click the icon that looks like a plant in the ribbon.
	- It is circled in red in the below photo.
![[Obsidian Ribbon with Digital Garden circled in red.png|Obsidian Ribbon with Digital Garden circled in red.png]]

You will see the below pop-up.

Wait until the popup is done and then hit publish.
- In the upper right corner, you will see a bar that says, "Publishing notes…"
- When it is done, it will say, "Notes successfully published."
That's it!
