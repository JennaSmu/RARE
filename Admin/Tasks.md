# Publishing This:
1. Figure out how to put this information into WRMD or ask universities like Cornell University if this would be helpful?
2. Publish each daily note and bird note. 
	1. Currently working on bird notes. On: [2251 RTHA](../RARE%20Birds/2251%20RTHA.md)
3. Update [RARE Vault Manual](../RARE%20Vault%20Manual/RARE%20Vault%20Manual.md) and the notes in that folder. Make sure it makes sense. 


## Website:
- [Merge with the RARE website we already have? ](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/public-landing-page-for-password-protected-publish-vault/71330/2)
	- Colin runs the RARE website

# Possible Future Projects:
- Add a map view for the location data from birds.
	- I tried both Map View and Obsidian Leaflet but I couldn't add my properties and there wasn't a way to code in different uses for the different properties (ex: Separate dealings of Recovery GPS and Release GPS)
	- For Map View, use dataview to convert GPS locations into the geolocations it recognizes along with different tags to have separate markers. I then copy that information into some note and use that to generate my map.
