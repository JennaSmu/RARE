Properties = metadata about the note.
- It is information that is kept in the note that can be easily accessed through code throughout Obsidian.

Ex:
- In this note, I am using the aliases property. This allows me to enter different things I want this note to be called. So whether I am searching for Properties (plural) or Property (singular) both get me to this note.
- I also have the dg-publish property. With it toggled on, this means that this note is allowed to be published to the website.
