The purpose of this note is to explain several concepts common in this vault. For this, we will be using the Dashboard/Homepage note as an example.

If you want you can open [RARE Obsidian Vault](../Admin/RARE%20Obsidian%20Vault.md) in another tab. Or you can scroll down and see the embedded sections I will talk about.

# Recent Notes:

This section shows the most recent Daily Note.
Another way to switch between notes is to use the üóìÔ∏è icon that is in the ribbon.

![RARE Obsidian Vault > Recent Notes](../Admin/RARE%20Obsidian%20Vault.md#Recent%20Notes)

# Current Birds:

This section uses the Dataview plugin to pull in a table of the Birds in Clinic and a table to pull in a table of the Birds at Barn. That way, you can get a quick overview of who we are caring for right now.

# Notices and Tasks:
In this section of the Homepage, I have several Dataviewjs code blocks to pull different tags.

> [!tip]- What are Tags?
> - Tags include # and then some kind of text immediately after it. It's another way you can link things together in Obsidian.
> - I have several tags already in place. So, all you need to do is enter # and don't put a space and you'll see the drop down menu for tags. You can enter some text and it will limit the tags with those characters in it.

The idea I had here was that throughout the daily notes when there was something that needed to be done with a bird such as saying that a tail sheath needed to be added tomorrow, a tag could be added and then people could look at the tag list to find the appropriate tag.

I've added tags to each of the tasks and they get separated into the different sections.

Here is what the different sections mean:

| Callout     | Tags Included                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Attention   | #‚ö†Ô∏è-attention = a general tag that I have been using for anything that I interpret as being a sort of heads-up. There may not be anything actionable but still good for others to know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Maintenance | #üõ†Ô∏è-maintenance  = a tag I have been using for tasks that show that something is broken or has been fixed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Bird Care   | #ü¶Öü©∫-bird-care/short-term  = something relating to a specific bird but the item is something short term. Ex: A tail sheath needs to be applied the next day. <br>#ü¶Öü©∫-bird-care/long-term  = something relating to a specific bird but the item is something more long-term that will be relevant to that bird's data. Ex: Finding out after getting a bird's X-rays, that what was thought to be fracture is not a fracture. |

# What to take away from this:
- The Homepage displays some uses of the Dataview plug-in.
- So, now that you get a sense of what the vault has by looking at the Homepage, let's go into a Daily Note.
