If you do not know how to format information in Obsidian, follow this short guide to quickly paste your daily information into Obsidian.
- Someone else who knows how to correctly format it will do that for you.
If you do know how to format go to: [Enter Daily Notes with formatting](./Enter%20Daily%20Notes%20with%20formatting.md)

# Step 1: Make a new Daily Note:
- On the left side of the screen is the ribbon. Look over there and click the icon that looks like a calendar.
- The screenshot below shows it circled in red.

# Step 2: Click on the date
- Click on the date you have information to enter.

## If the date does not currently have a daily note:
- If the date you want to create does not have a daily note, you will get this prompt.
- Go ahead and click Create.

This is what a fresh new daily note looks like.

# Step 3: Enter your information!

Go ahead and start typing just like you would normally do in the Google Doc.

In order to bold text you can:
- Highlight and and enter Ctrl + B on the keyboard
- Highlight text
	- Right Click
		- Go to Format
			- Hit Bold
- Enter \** (two asterisks)
	- To stop bolding enter another \**

In order to enter a bullet point, you can:
- Just type a - (a dash), then space and keep typing.

# Step 4: Syncing

Now, you can leave the note up or close the current tab or close Obsidian all together.
- Either way, it doesn't matter as all changes will be synced with the other computers.

The only thing is that your current changes will not be up on the website. If you want to update the website right now, see the below steps. Otherwise, you can just leave it and someone else will update it.

## Updating the website:
- On the keyboard enter: Ctrl + P
	- It is Ctrl and then P.
- Search "publish"
- See the option that says: Digital Garden: Publish Single Note
	- Hit enter
- In the upper right corner, you will see a bar that says, "Publishing noteâ€¦"
- When it is done, it will say, "Note successfully published."

You did it!

- Click the icon that looks like a plant in the ribbon.
	- It is circled in red in the below photo.
