I have charts for each year, each major county, and each species. The collection of each of these graphs is in an Obsidian canvas. This is a mindmap that allows me to see all the charts at once.

I would recommend just going through the Charts folder to see all the different types.

All the Charts do not need to be updated by you. They automatically update.

What does need to be done:
- The [Quarterly Charts]({{< ref "Quarterly Charts" >}}) notes needs to be exported as PDF every 3 months to be shared within RARE.
- Every new year, a new canvas with all the charts for that year needs to be created.
	- Even for someone who doesn't know code, it's simple. You copy the code from the previous year into a new note and then change the first line from saying the previous year to this year.

That's all I got for the manual for now. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to Jay.
