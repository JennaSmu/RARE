I think most of the sections are pretty explanatory.

Some things I want to highlight though include that:
- Body Condition State is where I usually put the [Keel score](../Admin/Codes/Keel%20score.md).
- I have a code for [⛓️‍💥 FX](../Admin/Codes/Fracture.md)
- Remember to follow the rules explained here: [Filling in a Table in a Callout](./Filling%20in%20a%20Table%20in%20a%20Callout.md)
