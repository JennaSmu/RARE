I think most of the sections are pretty explanatory.

Some things I want to highlight though include that:
- Body Condition State is where I usually put the [Keel score]({{< ref "Keel score" >}}).
- I have a code for [⛓️‍💥 FX]({{< ref "Fracture" >}})
- Remember to follow the rules explained here: [Filling in a Table in a Callout]({{< ref "Filling in a Table in a Callout" >}})
