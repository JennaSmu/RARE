Here are the different codes I typically enter in the food callout in the Daily Notes:

# Food:
- [🐀 JR](../Admin/Codes/Food/Jumbo%20Rat.md)
- [🐥Qu](../Admin/Codes/Food/Quail.md)
- [🐟 Fish](../Admin/Codes/Food/Fish.md)
- [🐀 smR](../Admin/Codes/Food/Small%20Rat.md)
- 🐭
	- For the mice, I typically just add that emoji myself by pressing the Windows Key + . (>/. key) and then looking up mouse/mice

# Food Delivery:
- [🟡WF](../Admin/Codes/Whole%20food.md)
- [🔪 Cut open](../Admin/Codes/Cut%20open.md)

- [🫱 HF](../Admin/Codes/Handfed.md)
