Here are the different codes I typically enter in the food callout in the Daily Notes:

# Food:
- [🐀 JR]({{< ref "Jumbo Rat" >}})
- [🐥Qu]({{< ref "Quail" >}})
- [🐟 Fish]({{< ref "Fish" >}})
- [🐀 smR]({{< ref "Small Rat" >}})
- 🐭
	- For the mice, I typically just add that emoji myself by pressing the Windows Key + . (>/. key) and then looking up mouse/mice

# Food Delivery:
- [🟡WF]({{< ref "Whole food" >}})
- [🔪 Cut open]({{< ref "Cut open" >}})
- [✂️ Cut up]({{< ref "Cut up" >}})
- [🫱 HF]({{< ref "Handfed" >}})
