Here are the different codes I typically enter in the food callout in the Daily Notes:

# Food:

	- For the mice, I typically just add that emoji myself by pressing the Windows Key + . (>/. key) and then looking up mouse/mice

# Food Delivery:
- [[Whole food|🟡WF]]
- [[Cut open|🔪 Cut open]]
- [[Cut up|✂️ Cut up]]
- [[Handfed|🫱 HF]]
